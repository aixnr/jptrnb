# Jupyter Notebooks

Collection of Jupyter Notebooks. Here is the list of notebooks currently in this repo (see `notebooks` folder).

| Notebook Name | Description
| :------------ | ------------
| Correlation Analysis | A quick tutorial using `pd.corr()` and how to create correlation plots with `sns.regplot()` and pure `matplotlib` approach with `np.polyfit()`.
| Creating Pandas DataFrame | Multiple ways to create a DataFrame.
| Hue in Matplotlib and Seaborn | With `seaborn`, we have `hue`. But, what about with `matplotlib`? We use `pd.groupby()`. Slightly longer code though. Also featuring `plt.colorbar()`.
| Project - Dr. STONE | Please refer to [Dr. STONE Text Mining Project](https://meta.caspershire.net/dr-stone-text-mining-project/) on Caspershire Meta.
| Qual Exam Stat | Basically, how to use `ax.twinx()` to plot a dual-axis plot.
| Scatterplot Random Example | How to use `np.random.normal()`. I think. Yeah that's it.
| Stacked Bar Chart | Generate a stacked bar chart with either `ax.bar()` with `bottom` keyword argument, or perhaps a slightly less painful way with `df.pivot().loc[].plot(kind = bar, stacked = True)`. Also featuring `stack_print_number()` function.
| Flow Cytometry and Lognormal Dist | Notebook created to illustrate flow cytometry plot, how to generate lognormal dist, using python decorator, and using `ScalarFormatter()`.
