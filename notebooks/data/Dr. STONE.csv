1,1,00:00:07,"that day, everyone in the world turned to stone."
1,2,00:00:15,"listen up, senku!"
1,3,00:00:16,i've made up my mind.
1,4,00:00:18,i'm going to confess the feelings i've had for yuzuriha for the past five years!
1,5,00:00:23,yeah?
1,6,00:00:24,"well, that sure does sound interesting."
1,7,00:00:28,i'll be cheering for you so hard that my vocal cords snap.
1,8,00:00:30,from here in this science lab.
1,9,00:00:32,you will?
1,10,00:00:34,"thanks, senku!"
1,11,00:00:35,"shut up. i'm not cheering one millimeter for you, you big oaf."
1,12,00:00:40,what?!
1,13,00:00:40,make up your mind!
1,14,00:00:41,and you haven't said anything for five years?
1,15,00:00:44,"how illogical can you be, idiot?"
1,16,00:00:46,i've got something for you that's logical as hell.
1,17,00:00:50,a drug that'll stimulate your pheromone output to the max.
1,18,00:00:53,"a love potion, if you will."
1,19,00:00:55,"take this, and you're set, ten billion percent."
1,20,00:01:02,"thanks, senku, but sorry."
1,21,00:01:06,i can't rely on cheap tricks.
1,22,00:01:12,"seriously, senku?"
1,23,00:01:14,a love potion?
1,24,00:01:16,like those even exist.
1,25,00:01:19,it's just gasoline.
1,26,00:01:20,i refined it from plastic bottle caps.
1,27,00:01:23,"think about the molecular structure of polyethylene, moron."
1,28,00:01:27,it's just a long gasoline molecule with a few hydrocarbons chopped off.
1,29,00:01:30,you can tell by looking at it.
1,30,00:01:32,"uh, no, i can't."
1,31,00:01:33,no way.
1,32,00:01:34,so... wouldn't taiju-kun have died if he drank it?
1,33,00:01:40,i was ten billion percent sure he wouldn't drink it.
1,34,00:01:43,not that strait-laced idiot.
1,35,00:01:51,yuzuriha!
1,36,00:01:52,sorry to keep you waiting.
1,37,00:01:55,"so, what's up, taiju-kun?"
1,38,00:01:57,what did you want to tell me?
1,39,00:02:01,a hundred yen says he gets rejected.
1,40,00:02:03,three hundred yen says he gets rejected hard.
1,41,00:02:05,five hundred yen says he gets rejected at full power.
1,42,00:02:08,ten thousand yen says he actually doesn't.
1,43,00:02:11,seriously?!
1,44,00:02:13,"i was afraid that by telling her how i feel, she wouldn't even be my friend anymore."
1,45,00:02:19,i've been a coward all this time.
1,46,00:02:22,"hear me out, yuzuriha."
1,47,00:02:25,but today's the day.
1,48,00:02:27,"for the past five years, i've..."
1,49,00:02:35,what's that light?
1,50,00:02:52,yuzuriha!
1,51,00:02:53,hang on to that camphor tree!
1,52,00:02:55,"i don't know, but..."
1,53,00:02:59,what's going on? it's so dark.
1,54,00:03:00,i can't move.
1,55,00:03:01,i can't speak... someone help!
1,56,00:03:02,what's happening?!
1,57,00:03:02,help... help!
1,58,00:03:27,help me...
1,59,00:03:29,"mom, dad..."
1,60,00:03:33,am i... going... to die?
1,61,00:03:55,i'm not dead!
1,62,00:03:57,"i have to stay focused, or it'll suck me in."
1,63,00:04:00,"wake up, damn it!"
1,64,00:04:01,yuzuriha will be all right.
1,65,00:04:03,i'm sure she's safe.
1,66,00:04:06,i can't go down a coward.
1,67,00:04:08,i'm going to confess to yuzuriha!
1,68,00:04:18,i'm going to survive by willpower alone!
1,69,00:04:21,whether it's for weeks or months...
1,70,00:04:25,"i'll tell her, no matter what!"
1,71,00:04:32,how many decades has it been?
1,72,00:04:34,centuries?
1,73,00:04:35,millennia?
1,74,00:04:37,"well, i'm not giving up."
1,75,00:04:40,i'm gonna tell yuzuriha.
1,76,00:04:43,"i'll survive, even if it kills me!"
1,77,00:05:38,i broke out!
1,78,00:05:39,i broke free! finally!
1,79,00:05:45,stone fragments?
1,80,00:05:57,i see.
1,81,00:05:58,so it did happen to everyone.
1,82,00:06:04,just how much time has gone by?
1,83,00:06:09,i'm sorry.
1,84,00:06:11,this is all i can do for you right now.
1,85,00:06:17,"as long as the terrain hasn't changed too much,"
1,86,00:06:19,i should be able to follow the river back.
1,87,00:06:22,back to that camphor tree...
1,88,00:06:28,"hey, something fell down."
1,89,00:06:30,a stone carving of a bird?
1,90,00:06:32,whoever made this is amazing. look at the detail on the wings.
1,91,00:06:36,it looks so real.
1,92,00:06:37,maybe it is real.
1,93,00:06:40,my friend said he saw one like that somewhere else.
1,94,00:06:42,he posted a photo of it.
1,95,00:06:44,poor thing...
1,96,00:06:46,"it might be, like, a bird disease that makes its skin harden."
1,97,00:06:56,{\an8}weekdays
1,98,00:06:56,"{\an8}weekends, holidays"
1,99,00:06:56,{\an8}hours of
1,100,00:06:56,{\an8}operation
1,101,00:06:58,{\an8}animal advocacy week
1,102,00:07:00,no vet's office is going to be open before school hours even start.
1,103,00:07:04,"you never think things through, do you?"
1,104,00:07:06,yuzuriha!
1,105,00:07:07,"besides, there's no way that carving could be a real bird."
1,106,00:07:11,and you brought it to a vet?
1,107,00:07:13,you're so silly.
1,108,00:07:14,i'm embarrassed for you.
1,109,00:07:19,of all the people to just happen to run into me when i'm in the middle of being a dolt...
1,110,00:07:24,wait... run into me?
1,111,00:07:27,"yup, and here's another embarrassing kid who didn't think things through."
1,112,00:07:33,imagine that!
1,113,00:07:36,{\an8}shuei animal hospital
1,114,00:07:37,"come on, stop laughing."
1,115,00:07:39,you did the same thing.
1,116,00:07:41,we're gonna be late for school now.
1,117,00:07:43,"yeah, you're right!"
1,118,00:07:53,yuzuriha.
1,119,00:08:00,i'd never mistake you.
1,120,00:08:02,even after thousands of years.
1,121,00:08:05,you've been alive all this time.
1,122,00:08:24,good job staying alive!
1,123,00:08:26,"well done, camphor tree!"
1,124,00:08:28,"this whole time, you kept yuzuriha"
1,125,00:08:30,from washing away and breaking apart!
1,126,00:08:34,i'm sorry i couldn't protect you.
1,127,00:08:38,"actually, you were the one who was protecting me, yuzuriha."
1,128,00:08:43,"it's because of you that i was able to stay alive all this time,"
1,129,00:08:48,"alone in that hopeless darkness,"
1,130,00:08:51,for hundreds of years... thousands of years...
1,131,00:08:56,"all right, i can finally say it."
1,132,00:08:59,let me finish saying what i was about to say that day.
1,133,00:09:03,the rest of what i was saying on that day so long ago...
1,134,00:09:23,i've loved you...
1,135,00:09:26,for hundreds of years...
1,136,00:09:28,thousands of years...
1,137,00:09:52,"i'm going to save you, yuzuriha."
1,138,00:09:54,"i have no idea how yet,"
1,139,00:09:57,but i will—
1,140,00:10:01,"{\an8}follow the river downstream, big oaf"
1,141,00:10:03,"""follow the river downstream, big oaf."""
1,142,00:10:16,"so you're finally awake, you big oaf."
1,143,00:10:23,"you're alive, senku?!"
1,144,00:10:26,don't hug me while you're buck naked!
1,145,00:10:28,i'll kill you!
1,146,00:10:32,"today is october 5th, 5738."
1,147,00:10:36,you slept in for a hell of a long time.
1,148,00:10:39,i've been up and working for over six months already.
1,149,00:10:43,so it's been...
1,150,00:10:46,"a good 3,700 years."
1,151,00:10:49,how can you tell exactly what day it is?
1,152,00:10:54,i just counted.
1,153,00:10:56,how else would i know?
1,154,00:11:00,"four, five, six, seven, eight..."
1,155,00:11:07,"damn, i almost lost consciousness again."
1,156,00:11:10,"i peak every 800,000 seconds or so."
1,157,00:11:15,i guess it's like when you have diarrhea.
1,158,00:11:19,think and count at the same time.
1,159,00:11:22,use your brain in parallel.
1,160,00:11:24,"116,427,065,530 seconds."
1,161,00:11:29,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven..."
1,162,00:11:37,in that darkness?
1,163,00:11:40,the entire time?
1,164,00:11:42,"even if i could have awakened by sheer willpower,"
1,165,00:11:45,"if i'd woken up naked in the winter,"
1,166,00:11:47,trying to find food would have been an instant game over.
1,167,00:11:50,starting in the spring is a must for survival.
1,168,00:11:54,an accurate account of the time was information that i absolutely needed.
1,169,00:12:00,"all right, we're here."
1,170,00:12:02,time to stop blabbering and get to work.
1,171,00:12:05,"senku, did you..."
1,172,00:12:08,did you build this from scratch?
1,173,00:12:16,i don't have enough manpower.
1,174,00:12:18,just producing the bare minimum to keep myself alive takes all day.
1,175,00:12:22,"in order to rebuild civilization, i need a big, muscle-bound meathead."
1,176,00:12:27,"i've been waiting for you this whole time, taiju."
1,177,00:12:30,i was ten billion percent certain that you were alive.
1,178,00:12:33,there's no way a guy who was sointent on confessing to yuzuriha
1,179,00:12:38,would give in after just a few thousand years.
1,180,00:12:42,you aren't that weak.
1,181,00:12:44,yeah.
1,182,00:12:46,of course i'm not.
1,183,00:12:52,"i'm counting on you to do all the brainy stuff, senku."
1,184,00:12:57,you can count on me to do the heavy lifting!
1,185,00:13:02,humanity spent two million years getting from the stone age to the modern age.
1,186,00:13:07,we're going to sprint all the way back to the top.
1,187,00:13:10,i'm going to take the world back.
1,188,00:13:13,and i'll figure out the science behind the petrification and our revival.
1,189,00:13:17,i'm going to save yuzuriha.
1,190,00:13:21,the two of us high school brats
1,191,00:13:23,are going to build a civilization out of nothing.
1,192,00:13:26,we're going to become the adam and eve of this stone world.
1,193,00:13:31,this is exhilarating.
1,194,00:13:43,"at least it's a huge haul, i guess."
1,195,00:13:46,what kind of cheat gave you that stamina?
1,196,00:13:52,amanita virosa: poisonous.
1,197,00:13:53,buna shimeji: edible.
1,198,00:13:55,amanita muscaria: poisonous.
1,199,00:13:56,you can't tell this one's bad? it looks like it's right out of mario.
1,200,00:13:59,next.
1,201,00:14:00,mugwort: edible.
1,202,00:14:02,monkshood.
1,203,00:14:03,"who is there to kill, you moron?"
1,204,00:14:08,yum!
1,205,00:14:09,how did you season this?
1,206,00:14:11,it's just salt that i pulled from seawater.
1,207,00:14:13,humans can enjoy just about anything with a pinch of salt.
1,208,00:14:16,"it's important for pickling, too."
1,209,00:14:19,you could say it's primitive man's greatest discovery.
1,210,00:14:22,"thanks, senku, for everything!"
1,211,00:14:25,i'm going to make up for the thinking i can't do
1,212,00:14:27,with brute force and diligence!
1,213,00:14:32,time to scavenge the other side!
1,214,00:14:35,"hey, they're wild."
1,215,00:14:37,are these edible?
1,216,00:14:40,thinking won't help.
1,217,00:14:41,eating some will!
1,218,00:14:50,i've seen him on tv before.
1,219,00:14:52,"he's the ""strongest primate high-schooler,"""
1,220,00:14:55,shishio tsukasa.
1,221,00:14:58,"it happened to him, too?"
1,222,00:15:08,look!
1,223,00:15:11,someone besides me and senku has survived!
1,224,00:15:15,who left this here?!
1,225,00:15:16,"i did, idiot."
1,226,00:15:18,it was you?!
1,227,00:15:21,are we the only humans left in the world?
1,228,00:15:25,we'll get more humans.
1,229,00:15:27,that's a top priority.
1,230,00:15:29,what future does humanity have with just us two dudes trudging on?
1,231,00:15:34,that's true.
1,232,00:15:35,"besides, why exactly were we freed from our petrification after 3,700 years?"
1,233,00:15:41,the rock rotted?
1,234,00:15:43,yeah.
1,235,00:15:44,"supposing this weird mineral was corroded,"
1,236,00:15:48,isn't it suspicious that the two of us got out at almost the same time?
1,237,00:15:51,"only six months apart after 3,700 years."
1,238,00:15:54,there's a logical explanation behind every coincidence.
1,239,00:15:58,you and i both washed up near this cave.
1,240,00:16:03,look at that stuff dripping from up there.
1,241,00:16:07,it's the miracle liquid made from bat guano...
1,242,00:16:11,nitric acid.
1,243,00:16:12,what?! nitric acid?!
1,244,00:16:14,what's that?!
1,245,00:16:16,"i knew you'd say that, you big oaf."
1,246,00:16:18,i'm not gonna waste time even explaining the gist of it.
1,247,00:16:22,so you're saying this something-or-other acid corrodes the stone and revives them?
1,248,00:16:27,if only it were so simple.
1,249,00:16:38,"i've been trying like a madman,"
1,250,00:16:40,using every method available to me.
1,251,00:16:45,so many times... so many dozens of times...
1,252,00:16:48,this is all in the realm of fantasy.
1,253,00:16:51,is it mineral? is it cellular?
1,254,00:16:54,i don't even have the equipment to find out anymore.
1,255,00:16:57,so there are things in this world that even science can't explain?
1,256,00:17:03,here we go again with that tired cliché.
1,257,00:17:06,that's why you hypothesize and experiment over and over.
1,258,00:17:10,science is a slow process.
1,259,00:17:12,"if only i had liquor, though..."
1,260,00:17:16,"with the alcohol in liquor,"
1,261,00:17:16,{\an8}ethanol
1,262,00:17:16,{\an8}nitric acid
1,263,00:17:18,i could combine the nitric acid and ethanol to make nital.
1,264,00:17:22,it's literally an industrial-strength etching agent.
1,265,00:17:25,"what did you just say, senku?"
1,266,00:17:27,huh? i said nital.
1,267,00:17:29,it gets into the ferrite grain boundary and—
1,268,00:17:31,not that! i don't understand the brainy stuff.
1,269,00:17:34,"but ""if only i had liquor""?"
1,270,00:17:37,couldn't we make wine out of grapes?
1,271,00:17:43,"not bad, you big oaf!"
1,272,00:17:46,{\an8}laboratory
1,273,00:17:55,"okay, you can do all the grunt work from now on."
1,274,00:17:58,that makes more sense.
1,275,00:18:03,{\an8}laboratory
1,276,00:18:03,making wine couldn't be easier.
1,277,00:18:05,"crush grapes and raisins and stuff, put it in a container,"
1,278,00:18:09,and just mix it every day until it's done.
1,279,00:18:13,though it would have been a crime
1,280,00:18:15,to make liquor without a license back in our day.
1,281,00:18:20,three weeks...
1,282,00:18:21,that should do it.
1,283,00:18:23,"you know, senku, this would count as underage drinking, though."
1,284,00:18:28,not a problem.
1,285,00:18:29,"we're well over 3,700 years old."
1,286,00:18:32,"oh, you're right!"
1,287,00:18:41,it's better than i thought it'd be.
1,288,00:18:43,though it's about ten billion times worse than what's on the market.
1,289,00:18:46,i never knew it was so easy to make with just grapes.
1,290,00:18:49,one step at a time.
1,291,00:18:52,"things are about to get a little more tedious, though."
1,292,00:18:56,"distilling wine for dummies,"
1,293,00:18:58,starting with brandy.
1,294,00:19:00,"distilling, huh?"
1,295,00:19:02,no idea what that means!
1,296,00:19:03,i knew you'd say that.
1,297,00:19:05,"heat it, cool it, drip it."
1,298,00:19:08,that concentrates the alcohol.
1,299,00:19:10,don't worry. people in the mesopotamian civilization
1,300,00:19:13,were doing it in 3000 b.c. using clay pots.
1,301,00:19:17,there's nothing you can't do if you try.
1,302,00:19:19,this is exhilarating.
1,303,00:21:09,"let me teach you, big oaf..."
1,304,00:21:12,it's not that there are things that science can't explain.
1,305,00:21:19,you look for the rules behind those things.
1,306,00:21:22,"science is just the name for the steady,"
1,307,00:21:25,pain-in-the-ass effort that goes into doing it.
1,308,00:21:58,one year since i started experimenting...
1,309,00:22:01,it didn't take as long as i thought.
1,310,00:22:06,it's a slow but steady effort.
1,311,00:22:09,i'm going to beat fantasy with science.
1,312,00:22:16,this is exhilarating.
1,313,00:24:01,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
1,314,00:24:58,{\an8}next episode
2,1,00:00:07,yuzuriha!
2,2,00:00:08,sorry to keep you waiting.
2,3,00:00:11,"so, what's up, taiju-kun?"
2,4,00:00:13,what did you want to tell me?
2,5,00:00:17,"i was afraid that by telling her how i feel, she wouldn't even be my friend anymore."
2,6,00:00:22,"hear me out, yuzuriha."
2,7,00:00:25,but today's the day.
2,8,00:00:27,"for the past five years, i've..."
2,9,00:00:34,what's that light?
2,10,00:00:38,"that day, everyone in the world turned to stone."
2,11,00:00:50,"so you're finally awake, you big oaf."
2,12,00:00:56,"today is october 5th, 5738."
2,13,00:01:00,"it's been a good 3,700 years."
2,14,00:01:04,how can you tell exactly what day it is?
2,15,00:01:08,i just counted.
2,16,00:01:10,how else would i know?
2,17,00:01:12,humanity spent two million years getting from the stone age to the modern age.
2,18,00:01:17,we're going to sprint all the way back to the top.
2,19,00:01:20,i'm going to take the world back.
2,20,00:01:23,and i'll figure out the science behind the petrification and our revival.
2,21,00:01:27,i'm going to save yuzuriha.
2,22,00:01:36,i'm going to beat fantasy with science.
2,23,00:01:41,this is exhilarating.
2,24,00:01:44,"so, senku, who are we reviving first?"
2,25,00:01:49,we're going to wake up everyone eventually.
2,26,00:01:51,what does it matter who we start with?
2,27,00:01:56,although it would suck if we woke up a murderer right off the bat.
2,28,00:02:01,i see.
2,29,00:02:05,i don't feel like choosing who we wake up.
2,30,00:02:10,"taiju, it's your choice."
2,31,00:02:15,"thanks, senku."
2,32,00:02:17,my answer is obvious.
2,33,00:03:57,the time has finally come.
2,34,00:04:02,"that water's going to undo the petrification and revive her, right?"
2,35,00:04:06,"yeah, it should."
2,36,00:04:09,"i tried it on a piece of a shattered statue, and it turned back into a corpse."
2,37,00:04:14,you're so disrespectful!
2,38,00:04:16,"i did try putting all the pieces back together first,"
2,39,00:04:20,but it looks like you can't save someone once they're dead.
2,40,00:04:24,they made a noble sacrifice.
2,41,00:04:25,send up a prayer or something.
2,42,00:04:27,right!
2,43,00:04:28,"rest in peace, rest in peace...rest in peace, rest in peace..."
2,44,00:04:33,"sorry i kept you waiting for 3,700 years, yuzuriha."
2,45,00:04:38,i'm going to bring you back to life now.
2,46,00:04:44,"wait, senku! yuzuriha's naked!"
2,47,00:04:51,we can't!
2,48,00:04:52,we can't revive her like this!
2,49,00:04:54,here we go again with your illogical nonsense...
2,50,00:04:58,we're in a stone world. it's kind of an emergency.
2,51,00:05:00,no one's going to care if your butt's showing
2,52,00:05:04,or if your dick's hanging out.
2,53,00:05:06,yuzuriha doesn't have a dick!
2,54,00:05:08,that's not my point!
2,55,00:05:10,we have to take her back to camp and put clothes on her first.
2,56,00:05:14,"how heavy is that statue, anyway?"
2,57,00:05:16,yuzuriha isn't fat!
2,58,00:05:19,that's not my point.
2,59,00:05:21,"i mean, wouldn't it be ten billion times quicker to wake her up and have her walk?"
2,60,00:05:28,how illogical can you—
2,61,00:05:34,"wait, big oaf!"
2,62,00:05:47,why is there a lion in japan?!
2,63,00:05:49,why do you think?
2,64,00:05:50,"it's from a zoo, obviously!"
2,65,00:05:53,the staff must've been petrified while the door was open or something!
2,66,00:05:56,"if they get out when no humans are around, every herbivore in the zoo is on the menu."
2,67,00:06:00,"and if they go out into the city, it's a pet buffet!"
2,68,00:06:03,so now they're literally the king of beasts!
2,69,00:06:07,"in this stone world, the humans aren't at the top of the food chain anymore!"
2,70,00:06:28,"why aren't they attacking us, though?"
2,71,00:06:33,they've never seen bipedals before.we must look creepy as hell to them.
2,72,00:06:39,we're the only humans in the world.
2,73,00:06:42,"they're alarmed, too."
2,74,00:06:44,but it's only a matter of time now.
2,75,00:06:46,"even if we get super lucky and make it all the way back to camp,"
2,76,00:06:50,the best we can do is fight them with spears.
2,77,00:06:52,this game was practically over before it even started!
2,78,00:07:05,"i can't let you die, senku!"
2,79,00:07:08,"you're humanity's last bastion, the only one with scientific knowledge."
2,80,00:07:11,"if it comes down to it, i'll be your shield!"
2,81,00:07:13,no!
2,82,00:07:16,think it over logically!
2,83,00:07:19,"i'm the brains, and you're the brawn."
2,84,00:07:22,we can't lose either one!
2,85,00:07:25,"if we're going to run, we need to run together!"
2,86,00:07:31,"all right, got it!"
2,87,00:07:35,"you've never even hit anyone, ever since you were little."
2,88,00:07:41,"your strong suit is fitness, not fighting."
2,89,00:07:46,"senku, if we can't outrun them, we have one last option..."
2,90,00:07:52,i found him earlier...
2,91,00:07:55,"the strongest primate high-schooler, shishio tsukasa."
2,92,00:08:02,"sorry, yuzuriha."
2,93,00:08:04,we need someone who can fight right now.
2,94,00:08:08,"if we do defeat the lions, i promise we'll—"
2,95,00:08:12,shut up already. let's just pour it on him.
2,96,00:08:23,no! we're surrounded!
2,97,00:08:26,they're coming!
2,98,00:08:39,sorry!
2,99,00:08:40,i'm sure you have no idea what's going on after being stuck for thousands of years...
2,100,00:08:45,what's the situation?
2,101,00:08:50,your whole body is covered in stone.
2,102,00:08:52,lions from your nine o'clock to two o'clock.
2,103,00:08:55,okay.
2,104,00:09:33,you can fill me in on the details of the situation later.
2,105,00:09:40,but i'll promise you one thing: you two will never be in danger again.
2,106,00:09:49,"from now on, i'll do the fighting."
2,107,00:09:56,"this is great, senku!"
2,108,00:09:58,"humanity now has brains,brawn, and brute force!"
2,109,00:10:01,the three musketeers are all here!
2,110,00:10:04,"i get that, but this shishio guy is way too strong."
2,111,00:10:10,is that a bad thing?
2,112,00:10:12,isn't it good to have someone like him around?
2,113,00:10:15,what if he turns out to be an evil bureaucrat with insatiable greed?
2,114,00:10:20,he's overpowered enough to beat down a lion with his bare hands.
2,115,00:10:23,"in a world without guns, he's ten billion percent unstoppable."
2,116,00:10:29,eek!
2,117,00:10:30,"come hither, yuzuriha."
2,118,00:10:33,no way!
2,119,00:10:35,we can't let that happen!
2,120,00:10:37,"sorry, but would you mind lending me some butchering tools?"
2,121,00:10:42,"a knife, or even just stone tools, if that's all we have."
2,122,00:10:47,you're gonna eat the lion?
2,123,00:10:48,you can eat lion?
2,124,00:10:51,it's not poisonous.
2,125,00:10:53,"although it is tough and reeks of ammonia, not to mention it tastes horrible."
2,126,00:10:57,"you've had it before, senku?!"
2,127,00:10:59,when i went to africa to research ebola.
2,128,00:11:02,what kind of high schooler are you?!
2,129,00:11:05,"though it was in self-defense, i did kill it with my own hands."
2,130,00:11:10,yes...
2,131,00:11:12,i want to give thanks to the circle of life by putting all of it to use.
2,132,00:11:18,that's all.
2,133,00:11:22,he's great!
2,134,00:11:24,"aren't you glad, senku?"
2,135,00:11:25,he's no evil bureaucrat!
2,136,00:11:27,he's a super good guy!
2,137,00:11:32,i hope so.
2,138,00:11:35,"well, i don't have even a millimeter of interest in stuff like gratitude,"
2,139,00:11:39,but i absolutely agree with not wasting meat.
2,140,00:11:59,the two of you built this?
2,141,00:12:03,yeah.
2,142,00:12:05,"hang on for a little longer, yuzuriha."
2,143,00:12:08,we'll save you as soon as we have enough of that miracle water...
2,144,00:12:10,the something-or-other acid.
2,145,00:12:18,{\an8}laboratory
2,146,00:12:19,laboratory?
2,147,00:12:22,i'm shishio tsukasa.
2,148,00:12:25,you can call me tsukasa.
2,149,00:12:28,"last names don't really mean much in this world, do they?"
2,150,00:12:31,"i'm senku, the sane one who's in charge of science."
2,151,00:12:35,"that's taiju, the simple one who's in charge of heavy lifting."
2,152,00:12:37,"i'm taiju, the simple one."
2,153,00:12:40,nice to meet you.
2,154,00:12:41,"if you need any thinking done, ask senku."
2,155,00:12:44,what do you usually have to eat?
2,156,00:12:46,"mainly wild greens and mushrooms,"
2,157,00:12:49,"and the occasional rabbit for meat, when we can catch one."
2,158,00:12:51,all i ever dream about lately is eating meat until my belly's about to explode!
2,159,00:12:57,"well, you won't be living like that..."
2,160,00:13:02,any longer.
2,161,00:13:35,i'll be in charge of fighting and hunting.
2,162,00:13:40,this is awesome!
2,163,00:13:43,"now that i'm on your side, you'll never have any shortage of prey again."
2,164,00:13:52,i see.
2,165,00:13:54,"so if you cook it immediately, you don't need a fridge to keep it from going bad."
2,166,00:13:58,i'm not cooking it.
2,167,00:14:00,i'm using the aldehydes in the smoke to kill the microbes.
2,168,00:14:04,"to put it simply enough for you to understand, i'm smoking it."
2,169,00:14:09,"if senku and i work together, we'll have plenty of preserved food."
2,170,00:14:15,now we can finally take the first step toward civilization.
2,171,00:14:18,we were still at step zero?!
2,172,00:14:24,"hey, tsukasa, what's wrong?"
2,173,00:14:43,sorry for startling you.
2,174,00:14:47,this person was buried under the rock.
2,175,00:14:50,he really is a good guy!
2,176,00:14:54,"he's a superhero at this point, huh?"
2,177,00:15:01,"man, i'm full."
2,178,00:15:05,time for a fun quiz.
2,179,00:15:09,what's the most important thing we need for a technological civilization?
2,180,00:15:14,ten billion points for the correct answer.
2,181,00:15:18,technological civilization?
2,182,00:15:20,the most important thing we need?
2,183,00:15:24,smartphones!
2,184,00:15:26,"sure, smartphones!"
2,185,00:15:27,"smartphones would be nice to have, huh?"
2,186,00:15:30,how many tens of billions of years ahead are you?!
2,187,00:15:33,steel?
2,188,00:15:35,"steel, too, but that's later."
2,189,00:15:38,there's something more useful.
2,190,00:15:41,calcium carbonate.
2,191,00:15:43,of course!
2,192,00:15:44,"as always, i'm totally clueless!"
2,193,00:15:46,"ah, you mean lime."
2,194,00:15:48,yeah.
2,195,00:15:49,that's putting it in terms that a simple mind can understand.
2,196,00:15:53,the stuff they use to chalk athletic fields.
2,197,00:15:56,so we're going to be looking for a gym storage room
2,198,00:15:59,to get something-or-other carbonate?!
2,199,00:16:01,"yeah, that's it. a gym storage room."
2,200,00:16:04,"if only there were any still around 3,700 years later!"
2,201,00:16:13,"you know the shells that have been so useful for trimming your beard, big oaf?"
2,202,00:16:20,"pulverize them into powder, and you have that something-or-other carbonate stuff."
2,203,00:16:27,all right!
2,204,00:16:28,"brawn duty, here i come!"
2,205,00:16:38,nothing's as exhilarating as calcium carbonate.
2,206,00:16:42,there are four insanely useful ways to use it.
2,207,00:16:46,"first, agriculture."
2,208,00:16:48,we use it to blow away all the hydrogen ions.
2,209,00:16:51,"in other words, it upgrades the soil."
2,210,00:16:54,"second, construction."
2,211,00:16:56,"cook it together with sand, and you have mortar."
2,212,00:17:00,mortar is basic cement.
2,213,00:17:03,we can build huge furnaces and houses.
2,214,00:17:05,"third, soap."
2,215,00:17:08,"gather sodium carbonate from seaweed,"
2,216,00:17:11,"mix it with oil, and the reaction creates soap."
2,217,00:17:15,getting sick means game over in this world.
2,218,00:17:18,this little chunk that keeps germs off of us
2,219,00:17:21,is our stone of life in a world with no doctors.
2,220,00:17:24,it's our doctor stone.
2,221,00:17:28,"senku, you're an amazing man."
2,222,00:17:33,"in the moment after i revived, too,"
2,223,00:17:36,you communicated the situation quickly and calmly.
2,224,00:17:39,i've never seen anyone as clever as you.
2,225,00:17:42,"i admire you, truly."
2,226,00:17:49,a man who praises a man to his face is full of ulterior motives.
2,227,00:17:55,it's been that way for ten billion years.
2,228,00:17:59,what's your point?
2,229,00:18:02,"oh, dear."
2,230,00:18:04,i really didn't mean anything by it.
2,231,00:18:07,i have a feeling you might be able to build modern civilization from scratch.
2,232,00:18:13,yes.
2,233,00:18:14,that's all i wanted to say.
2,234,00:18:18,whew!
2,235,00:18:20,"so this is how you build civilization, huh?"
2,236,00:18:25,"yeah, one step at a time."
2,237,00:18:28,we're slowly but surely approaching modern civilization.
2,238,00:18:32,"so, what's the fourth thing?"
2,239,00:18:35,you said there were four handy uses for seashells.
2,240,00:18:41,"no, three."
2,241,00:18:43,didn't i say three?
2,242,00:18:45,huh? did you?
2,243,00:18:47,"man, even my memory is screwy!"
2,244,00:19:14,shells! shells! shells! shells! shells! shells! shells! shells! shells! shells!
2,245,00:19:25,we're free in this stone world.
2,246,00:19:29,shells never belonged to anyone.
2,247,00:19:34,"the same goes for the sea, and the land."
2,248,00:19:41,there was once a poor boy who tried to make
2,249,00:19:45,"a necklace out of seashells for his younger sister, who was undergoing surgery."
2,250,00:19:51,his sister loved the little mermaid.
2,251,00:19:56,"but then, a middle-aged man who owned the fishing rights to that spot arrived..."
2,252,00:20:02,"and with him, the stench of liquor."
2,253,00:20:08,"the boy who was collecting shells... or rather,"
2,254,00:20:12,"according to the man, the boy who was stealing shells,"
2,255,00:20:16,was beaten so badly that his face was unrecognizable.
2,256,00:20:19,he was never able to help his sister be like the little mermaid.
2,257,00:20:37,"you do know what you're doing, don't you, tsukasa?"
2,258,00:20:42,you just killed a man.
2,259,00:20:46,"i know that, of course."
2,260,00:20:49,"senku, do you intend to bring back everyone, including the grown-ups"
2,261,00:20:54,whose hearts are tainted?
2,262,00:20:56,"sure, they'll be grateful to you at first."
2,263,00:21:01,"but as soon as civilization returns, the rich and powerful seniors will say,"
2,264,00:21:07,"""that used to be my land."" ""pay your rent."" ""pay your taxes."""
2,265,00:21:13,they'll rob the poor youth of our future again.
2,266,00:21:18,we must not bring that world back.
2,267,00:21:24,this is a stone world.
2,268,00:21:26,an untainted paradise.
2,269,00:21:29,we'll revive only the pure-hearted youth
2,270,00:21:33,and live in a natural world owned by no one.
2,271,00:21:38,it's a chance to purify humanity.
2,272,00:21:41,"don't you agree, senku?"
2,273,00:21:54,not at all.
2,274,00:21:56,not even a millimeter.
2,275,00:21:58,i'm a technology-loving boy who gets excited over
2,276,00:22:03,mechs and space and doraemon and stuff like that.
2,277,00:22:08,i'm going to use the power of science to rescue every single person.

3,2,00:00:12,you two will never be in danger again.
3,3,00:00:17,"from now on, i'll do the fighting."
3,4,00:00:22,this shishio guy is way too strong.
3,5,00:00:29,"senku, do you intend to bring back everyone, including the grown-ups"
3,6,00:00:33,whose hearts are tainted?
3,7,00:00:36,this is a stone world.
3,8,00:00:38,an untainted paradise.
3,9,00:00:42,we'll revive only the pure-hearted youth
3,10,00:00:45,and live in a natural world owned by no one.
3,11,00:00:50,it's a chance to purify humanity.
3,12,00:00:54,"don't you agree, senku?"
3,13,00:01:02,this guy is seriously bad news.
3,14,00:01:05,"then again, if we hadn't woken him up, we would've been killed by the lions."
3,15,00:01:09,i guess we didn't really have a choice.
3,16,00:01:11,"he wants to help out the youth, too,"
3,17,00:01:14,so i'm sure he'll stay under control until he learns the recipe for the revival fluid.
3,18,00:01:18,"even if it kills me, i have to keep quiet about the miracle fluid in the cave."
3,19,00:01:22,hey!
3,20,00:01:23,"good news, senku, tsukasa!"
3,21,00:01:27,we have a full pot of miracle fluid from the cave!
3,22,00:01:27,for yuzuriha
3,23,00:01:30,we can finally revive yuzuriha!
3,24,00:01:38,"what's this ""miracle fluid"" you speak of?"
3,25,00:01:46,let's not waste time standing here explaining it.
3,26,00:01:50,it'll be ten billion times faster to just show you.
3,27,00:01:53,you'd better feel honored to see this.
3,28,00:01:56,time to enjoy the humanity revival show.
3,29,00:03:32,{\an8}weapons of science
3,30,00:03:37,"all right, yuzuriha."
3,31,00:03:39,"we're finally going to save you,for real this time!"
3,32,00:03:45,what the hell?
3,33,00:03:46,this is just short of enough revival fluid for one person.
3,34,00:03:50,what?! did i take it out too soon?!
3,35,00:03:52,tsukasa and i will play word games or something while you go get more.
3,36,00:03:57,"so make a mad dash, big oaf."
3,37,00:03:59,thanks! i'll be right back!
3,38,00:04:02,i'll go full speed!
3,39,00:04:08,"in that case, i'll go, since i'm the fastest."
3,40,00:04:12,so would you mind telling me where this miracle fluid is?
3,41,00:04:17,i should've known he'd catch on.
3,42,00:04:20,"if he learns where the source of the revival fluid is,"
3,43,00:04:24,there's a ten billion percent chancehe's going to be able to stop
3,44,00:04:27,my operation: let's save every last human.
3,45,00:04:37,did tsukasa leave?
3,46,00:04:38,"yeah, in the blink of an eye."
3,47,00:04:41,he's as fast as you'd thi—
3,48,00:04:43,"let's make the revival fluid and bring yuzuriha back right away,"
3,49,00:04:48,while tsukasa isn't here.
3,50,00:04:56,bats...
3,51,00:04:59,touching it makes my finger yellow.
3,52,00:05:03,"so the ""miracle fluid"" is nitric acid."
3,53,00:05:19,what's going on?
3,54,00:05:20,{\an8}laboratory
3,55,00:05:20,you just said there wasn't quite enough revival fluid!
3,56,00:05:23,do you really think i'd set outa pot that was the wrong size?
3,57,00:05:27,good point!
3,58,00:05:28,then why did you send tsukasa after it?
3,59,00:05:31,it was double-edged bait.
3,60,00:05:32,"i wanted to get rid of him before reviving yuzuriha,"
3,61,00:05:35,even if it meant revealing where the cave was.
3,62,00:05:37,why do you want to get rid of tsukasa?
3,63,00:05:40,he's a good guy!
3,64,00:05:41,that's why he's too much to handle.
3,65,00:05:44,"i don't have even one millimeter of interest in his grand vision for a ""mighty world."""
3,66,00:05:53,i find civilization-building games more exhilarating.
3,67,00:05:59,all right.
3,68,00:06:00,you don't need to explain.
3,69,00:06:02,"senku, i trust what you say."
3,70,00:06:05,"something happened while i was gone, didn't it?"
3,71,00:06:09,yeah.
3,72,00:06:11,shishio tsukasa is a good guy...
3,73,00:06:17,and a murderer.
3,74,00:06:24,yuzuriha...
3,75,00:06:25,sorry to keep you waiting.
3,76,00:06:27,i... i...
3,77,00:06:30,i...
3,78,00:06:32,"i told you we're in a hurry, you big oaf!"
3,79,00:06:36,you just dumped it all over her!
3,80,00:06:38,"couldn't you be a bit more, like... you know!"
3,81,00:06:43,"wait, nothing's happening! is this all right?!"
3,82,00:06:46,"no, it's all right, yuzuriha!"
3,83,00:06:48,but is this all right?!
3,84,00:06:50,it takes time for the reaction to happen.
3,85,00:06:53,this is a kind of cryostasis.
3,86,00:06:55,it's like a protective coat made from trace metals in the body.
3,87,00:07:00,some mysterious mechanism causes those elements
3,88,00:07:02,"to phase-shift, maintaining a petrified state."
3,89,00:07:04,that's complicated!
3,90,00:07:06,seriously complicated!
3,91,00:07:08,"it's just a hypothesis, based on a whole year of painstaking experiments."
3,92,00:07:12,"the point is, if even one part of it gets nital on it and breaks down..."
3,93,00:07:19,it creates a cascade effect that travels across the entire body.
3,94,00:07:23,and the petrification is undone.
3,95,00:07:27,"hear me out, yuzuriha.for the past five years..."
3,96,00:07:31,i'm gonna tell yuzuriha.
3,97,00:07:32,"i'll survive, even if it kills me!"
3,98,00:07:34,it's because of you that i was able to stay alive all this time.
3,99,00:07:37,i'm sorry i couldn't protect you.
3,100,00:07:47,i've loved you... for hundreds of years...
3,101,00:07:52,thousands of years...
3,102,00:08:07,"yuzuriha, can you hear me? yuzuriha!"
3,103,00:08:12,taiju-kun?
3,104,00:08:16,"i'm sorry. i made you wait for 3,700 years..."
3,105,00:08:20,i'm sorry!
3,106,00:08:23,i have no idea what's going on. i just woke up.
3,107,00:08:27,"but, yeah... i think i know what's going on."
3,108,00:08:32,"you saved me, didn't you?"
3,109,00:08:36,wow... thanks.
3,110,00:08:42,it wasn't me.
3,111,00:08:44,it was all thanks to senku.
3,112,00:08:47,senku spent a whole year working on the revival fluid.
3,113,00:08:51,"sorry to barge in on your reunion chat,"
3,114,00:08:54,but make up your mind before tsukasa gets back.
3,115,00:08:57,we only have two options.
3,116,00:08:59,choose one.
3,117,00:09:01,"plan a: taiju and yuzuriha,"
3,118,00:09:04,"you two run away right now, and live somewhere far away."
3,119,00:09:08,"plan b: we fight together to stop tsukasa's murder spree,"
3,120,00:09:13,using the weapons of civilization.
3,121,00:09:15,the answer's obvious!
3,122,00:09:17,we're going to fight by your side!
3,123,00:09:19,"don't underestimate us, senku!"
3,124,00:09:22,"yeah! i have no idea what's going on, but i'll help, too!"
3,125,00:09:26,i'm not trying to be nice or anything.
3,126,00:09:28,it just seemed logical to give you both a chance to flee.
3,127,00:09:32,"if tsukasa really is killing people, i'll—"
3,128,00:09:35,"calling it ""killing people"""
3,129,00:09:38,is really a matter of perspective.
3,130,00:09:42,i'm culling them... for the benefit of the new world.
3,131,00:09:54,he doesn't even try to hide his murders from taiju or yuzuriha.
3,132,00:09:59,"in other words, anyone who gets in his way..."
3,133,00:10:10,"senku, if things go bad, take care of yuzuriha for me."
3,134,00:10:14,i'm going to stop tsukasa!
3,135,00:10:18,you damn simpleton!
3,136,00:10:21,the guy killed a lion with his bare hands.
3,137,00:10:24,"you're screwed, ten billion percent!"
3,138,00:10:27,you're forcing me to use the weapon i've been keeping secret!
3,139,00:10:35,i need to shoot it right between them and stop them!
3,140,00:10:52,you're the first person who's managed to remain standing after receiving my kick.
3,141,00:10:57,"yes... and even more interestingly, it wasn't that you"
3,142,00:11:00,"failed to attack me just now, but that you refused to."
3,143,00:11:03,why?
3,144,00:11:04,i don't hit people!
3,145,00:11:06,"you can hit me or kick me all you want,"
3,146,00:11:09,but stop destroying the statues!
3,147,00:11:13,killing people is bad!
3,148,00:11:19,"taiju, let me get this straight."
3,149,00:11:22,"you'll let me keep hitting you and never fight back,"
3,150,00:11:25,"therefore, don't destroy the statues."
3,151,00:11:27,is that right?
3,152,00:11:29,that's right!
3,153,00:11:36,i don't understand.
3,154,00:11:38,there's no deal being made here.
3,155,00:11:42,if you insist on getting in my way...
3,156,00:11:44,i don't care how many times you attack me! i won't stop trying to stop you!
3,157,00:11:48,that girl who was just revived...
3,158,00:11:50,what if i told you i'd kill her?
3,159,00:11:57,i see.
3,160,00:11:58,this is why senku-kun said it might be more logical for us to flee.
3,161,00:12:07,taiju-kun!
3,162,00:12:09,so that did hurt him.
3,163,00:12:11,he's bleeding like mad.
3,164,00:12:12,we'll have to let him sleep for a few days.
3,165,00:12:15,yes. let's not fight among ourselves.
3,166,00:12:18,"you protect yuzuriha,"
3,167,00:12:20,instead of worrying about statues of people you don't know.
3,168,00:12:24,and i'll do what i need to do.
3,169,00:12:29,i won't let you get in my way.
3,170,00:12:36,the crossbow arrow was moving at over 200 kilometers per hour.
3,171,00:12:40,he snatched it right out of the air...
3,172,00:12:44,"hey, get up!"
3,173,00:12:45,"come on! come on, come on!"
3,174,00:12:46,you said you'd let him sleep for a few days!
3,175,00:12:47,come on!
3,176,00:12:48,"you're not gonna go down that easily in front of tsukasa, are you, big oaf?"
3,177,00:12:54,of course i'm not!
3,178,00:12:57,you're okay now?
3,179,00:12:59,i'm built to last.
3,180,00:13:01,i've got plenty of energy left to spare!
3,181,00:13:03,thank goodness.
3,182,00:13:05,right! tsukasa!
3,183,00:13:06,we need to stop his murdering!
3,184,00:13:09,"hold it, big oaf."
3,185,00:13:10,i'm not giving up!
3,186,00:13:12,how simple-minded can you be?
3,187,00:13:14,we just learned that we can't stop him!
3,188,00:13:18,still...
3,189,00:13:24,there's only one way to stop a monster in this stone world.
3,190,00:13:31,advance civilization and make weapons of science.
3,191,00:13:45,such a waste...
3,192,00:13:47,"what are you doing, senku?"
3,193,00:13:48,i'm making it look like
3,194,00:13:50,tsukasa freaked us out and made us run off with just our food.
3,195,00:13:55,what are you talking about?
3,196,00:13:56,are we running away?
3,197,00:13:58,it's just an act.
3,198,00:14:01,"if we make weapons of science before he takes notice, we win."
3,199,00:14:05,"if he finds out first, we lose."
3,200,00:14:08,that's the kind of race this is.
3,201,00:14:13,we're going to go find materials to make weapons.
3,202,00:14:16,our goal is hakone!
3,203,00:14:18,"hey, it's just a huge 80-kilometer adventure, that's all."
3,204,00:14:22,"two full marathons, huh?"
3,205,00:14:24,five hours ought to do it.
3,206,00:14:26,only for a meathead like you.
3,207,00:14:32,the cherry blossoms seem different.
3,208,00:14:34,"the cherry blossoms we know, prunus yedoensis, aren't self-pollinating."
3,209,00:14:40,which means...
3,210,00:14:42,they must have gone extinct right off the bat.
3,211,00:14:57,"man, what a great view!"
3,212,00:14:59,perfect.
3,213,00:15:04,"what's that, senku?"
3,214,00:15:05,a sextant.
3,215,00:15:07,"it's been 35,970 seconds since sunrise as of now."
3,216,00:15:11,did you really just say that like it's no big deal?
3,217,00:15:14,senku counted for hundreds of billions of seconds while he was petrified.
3,218,00:15:18,this is a piece of cake for him.
3,219,00:15:20,"a sextant is supposed to tell you your current location based on the time,"
3,220,00:15:24,"but the accuracy is such trash, it's a complete joke."
3,221,00:15:29,"still, this trash is the only gps we have."
3,222,00:15:31,"we must be around kamakura, i guess."
3,223,00:15:34,i wish i knew our exact longitude and latitude.
3,224,00:15:37,are there any buildings that could serve as landmarks?
3,225,00:15:40,anything metal is rusted away.
3,226,00:15:42,there's nothing left.
3,227,00:15:46,"what's wrong, yuzuriha?"
3,228,00:15:52,isn't that...
3,229,00:16:00,that area's completely bare of trees for some reason.
3,230,00:16:06,kamakura's landmark is...
3,231,00:16:12,i know where we are.
3,232,00:16:14,"we're at 35 degrees, 19 minutes north,"
3,233,00:16:17,"139 degrees, 32 minutes east."
3,234,00:16:33,look! look!
3,235,00:16:46,"what's wrong, yuzuriha?!"
3,236,00:16:47,who made you cry?
3,237,00:16:49,was it me?!
3,238,00:16:50,"no, i'm not crying!"
3,239,00:16:52,"i mean, it's not that i'm not crying..."
3,240,00:16:56,"but it's not like that, taiju-kun."
3,241,00:17:00,"i just woke up today, and nothing feels real right now."
3,242,00:17:07,but seeing the great buddha of kamakura made me realize we really are in japan.
3,243,00:17:14,it really has been thousands of years...
3,244,00:17:18,"i started thinking about my mom and dad, and everyone else..."
3,245,00:17:32,there's nothing to worry about.
3,246,00:17:34,we're about to beat tsukasa and save all of humanity.
3,247,00:17:38,"he's right, yuzuriha!"
3,248,00:17:43,and the great buddha just told us the way!
3,249,00:17:45,he's stood for thousands of years without falling apart. he really is a god!
3,250,00:17:49,"wait, a buddha?"
3,251,00:17:51,"well, anyway, something like that!"
3,252,00:17:56,"well, yeah, they made the buddha out of bronze."
3,253,00:17:59,"scientifically, it just doesn't rot."
3,254,00:18:03,look!
3,255,00:18:04,there's absolutely no foliage around the buddha!
3,256,00:18:07,it's like he made it so we could find him easily!
3,257,00:18:10,"well, yeah, it's leaking copper ions like crazy."
3,258,00:18:14,it's just poisonous to most plants.
3,259,00:18:19,that's it! bronze!
3,260,00:18:20,we can use it to make mirrors!
3,261,00:18:22,time to upgrade my trash sextant!
3,262,00:18:25,i'll just help myself to some of this!
3,263,00:18:27,stop!
3,264,00:18:28,you blasphemous bastard!
3,265,00:18:30,it's a great buddha!
3,266,00:18:31,"shut up, simpleton! go away!"
3,267,00:18:36,no! the great buddha!
3,268,00:18:57,what the hell are you doing?
3,269,00:18:58,i have to protect us from beasts.
3,270,00:19:01,"tsukasa might come after us, too."
3,271,00:19:04,we're screwed either way if tsukasa catches up to us now.
3,272,00:19:07,it's illogical to worry about him.
3,273,00:19:10,i-i see.
3,274,00:19:12,hurry up and sleep.
3,275,00:19:13,"resting is part of your job, too, big oaf."
3,276,00:19:20,"that giant body's actually struggling for once, huh?"
3,277,00:19:24,i'm barely fine!
3,278,00:19:25,"i'm just tall enough, i mean!"
3,279,00:19:26,"i still have plenty of energy, though!"
3,280,00:19:29,not to worry!
3,281,00:19:31,"yuzuriha, your toe's still petrified."
3,282,00:19:35,"yeah, it does sort of get in the way, but i guess it's okay."
3,283,00:19:40,it's not oka—
3,284,00:19:45,that's cold!
3,285,00:19:47,"hey, the pain's going away, too."
3,286,00:19:51,"the revival fluid has rejuvenating properties, too?"
3,287,00:19:54,"no, it doesn't."
3,288,00:19:56,it's just that the small cracks get mended when the petrification is reversed.
3,289,00:20:01,haven't you noticed we're still alive even though our faces are cracked?
3,290,00:20:05,that's true.
3,291,00:20:06,let's head to our goal.
3,292,00:20:09,if you want to take a bath in actual rejuvenating fluid.
3,293,00:20:12,"when you say the goal in hakone, do you mean..."
3,294,00:20:22,"a room in disarray, hurried footsteps..."
3,295,00:20:26,did they run away in a panic?
3,296,00:20:30,yes... that's what they're trying to make me think.
3,297,00:20:34,how can i tell?
3,298,00:20:36,"senku, you aren't the kind of man to turn tail and run."
3,299,00:20:41,"why did he lie about taiju being unable to move, and then secretly head west?"
3,300,00:20:49,it's obvious.
3,301,00:20:51,senku is trying to make weapons of science to fight against me.
3,302,00:20:56,but where?
3,303,00:21:01,we made it to the goal!
3,304,00:21:03,hot springs!
3,305,00:21:04,wow...
3,306,00:21:06,"there's a great view of mount fuji, too."
3,307,00:21:08,you two better not have forgotten why we came all this way.
3,308,00:21:14,"so what's this ""weapon of science""?"
3,309,00:21:18,the greatest invention in human history...
3,310,00:21:20,smartphones?!
3,311,00:21:21,you sure love your smartphone.
3,312,00:21:24,no.
3,313,00:21:25,guns.
3,314,00:21:26,we're making gunpowder.
3,315,00:21:30,the stone age was two million years ago.
3,316,00:21:33,"and gunpowder was invented just recently, around 700 ad."
3,317,00:21:38,"basically, we're about to warp 1,998,700 years ahead in civilization."
3,318,00:21:47,this is exhilarating.
3,319,00:21:51,hakone.
3,320,00:21:52,"if they make gunpowder, i don't stand a chance."
3,321,00:21:55,i'm going to stop them before senku can make it.
3,322,00:22:00,"thankfully, japan is full of volcanoes."
3,323,00:22:04,"go to any hot spring, and you have an all-you-can-carry bargain sale"
3,324,00:22:08,"of sulfur, the main component of gunpowder."
3,325,00:22:14,it's the birth of our ultimate anti-tsukasa weapon: black powder.

4,1,00:00:08,shishio tsukasa is a good guy...
4,2,00:00:11,and a murderer.
4,3,00:00:15,"if we make weapons of science before he takes notice, we win."
4,4,00:00:20,"if he finds out first, we lose."
4,5,00:00:23,that's the kind of race this is.
4,6,00:00:25,guns.
4,7,00:00:27,we're making gunpowder.
4,8,00:00:31,this is exhilarating.

4,12,00:00:51,yuzuriha...
4,13,00:00:53,i should tell you about what happened while you were petrified.
4,14,00:00:59,"3,700 years ago, when i called you to the camphor tree..."
4,15,00:01:06,"hear me out, yuzuriha."
4,16,00:01:08,"for the past five years, i've..."
4,17,00:01:17,what were you about to say that day?
4,18,00:01:31,"yuzuriha, for the whole time i was petrified,"
4,19,00:01:35,i thought about finishing what i was saying.
4,20,00:01:38,"for hundreds of years, thousands of years..."
4,21,00:01:41,"but here, in this stone world,"
4,22,00:01:44,"with nowhere to run, i wouldn't feel right as a man telling you."
4,23,00:01:55,sorry! i'm sure you have no idea what i'm talking about...
4,24,00:02:00,"no, i do."
4,25,00:02:02,we have to bring back civilization.
4,26,00:02:05,"once we save humanity,"
4,27,00:02:09,"will you let me finish what i was saying 3,700 years ago, yuzuriha?"
4,28,00:02:17,"okay, got it."
4,29,00:02:19,we'll bring the world back.
4,30,00:02:22,i'm sure of it.
4,31,00:03:54,{\an8}fire the smoke signal
4,32,00:04:03,we have the three materials we need to make gunpowder.
4,33,00:04:07,we have them already?
4,34,00:04:08,all we need to do now is mix it.
4,35,00:04:10,it's time for our happy gunpowder cooking session!
4,36,00:04:14,kitchen
4,37,00:04:19,ingredient number one for gunpowder...
4,38,00:04:21,"sulfur, which we can get plenty of at this hot spring."
4,39,00:04:24,number two...
4,40,00:04:26,charcoal.
4,41,00:04:27,we can get all we need by burning wood.
4,42,00:04:30,"and number three,"
4,43,00:04:32,"the last, but most difficult: potassium nitrate."
4,44,00:04:36,"it'll take a hell of a long time to make this stuff, so..."
4,45,00:04:39,kukuku!
4,46,00:04:40,i've already made some to save us time!
4,47,00:04:47,"i feel like i've heard the word ""nitrate"" somewhere..."
4,48,00:04:50,nitric acid!
4,49,00:04:51,miracle water!
4,50,00:04:53,you got it from that cave?
4,51,00:04:55,"you're right for once, simpleton."
4,52,00:04:57,ten billion points for you.
4,53,00:04:59,"potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal all go in the mix,"
4,54,00:05:04,and a pinch of sugar as a secret ingredient gives it a little more oomph.
4,55,00:05:08,this is glucose that i made from grapes.
4,56,00:05:13,hey! my name is mecha-senku!
4,57,00:05:16,that recipe i just gave you is legit.
4,58,00:05:19,it can result in a real bomb.
4,59,00:05:21,so don't even think about trying it!
4,60,00:05:25,"finally, pound it until it's packed solid."
4,61,00:05:29,"pound it, huh?!"
4,62,00:05:31,leave the heavy lifting to me!
4,63,00:05:34,are you sure that's a good idea?
4,64,00:05:36,you might be strong enough to make it spark and go boom!
4,65,00:05:40,like flint!
4,66,00:05:42,"nah, you won't get any sparks by hitting stone with stone."
4,67,00:05:46,really?
4,68,00:05:51,"oh, you're right."
4,69,00:05:53,flint is more than just stone.
4,70,00:05:56,it needs to have metal in it to make sparks.
4,71,00:05:59,"hot springs,"

4,81,00:06:07,wai—
4,82,00:06:29,no problem!
4,83,00:06:30,our gunpowder cooking was a huge success!
4,84,00:06:33,i had no idea gunpowder was so powerful.
4,85,00:06:35,yeah.
4,86,00:06:37,there've been plenty of accidents where students
4,87,00:06:39,were experimenting with it and got their limbs blown off.
4,88,00:06:45,it can easily be lethal.
4,89,00:06:48,we're going to attack tsukasa-kun with this?
4,90,00:06:53,"no, we're going to make a deal."
4,91,00:06:57,tsukasa isn't a mindless killer.
4,92,00:07:00,"taiju, remember what he said when you went at him?"
4,93,00:07:04,let me get this straight.
4,94,00:07:06,"you'll let me keep hitting you and never fight back,"
4,95,00:07:09,"therefore, don't destroy the statues."
4,96,00:07:12,is that right?
4,97,00:07:13,that's right!
4,98,00:07:15,i don't understand.
4,99,00:07:17,there's no deal being made here.
4,100,00:07:19,"in other words, in the right circumstances, we can negotiate with him."
4,101,00:07:24,"as long as we have a gunpowder weapon, we have leverage."
4,102,00:07:30,"but if negotiations with tsukasa fall through,"
4,103,00:07:35,then we'll have to...
4,104,00:07:39,"if senku has already made gunpowder,"
4,105,00:07:44,i'll have to...
4,106,00:07:48,...kill him.
4,107,00:07:56,"all right, it's gotten a lot weaker."
4,108,00:08:00,"if tsukasa's after us, there's a ten billion percent chance he'll find us."
4,109,00:08:08,"senku-kun, taiju-kun..."
4,110,00:08:18,a smoke signal...
4,111,00:08:20,tsukasa-kun?!
4,112,00:08:21,"no, that's in the opposite direction."
4,113,00:08:24,"besides, tsukasa has no reason to reveal his location."
4,114,00:08:28,"what is it, then?"
4,115,00:08:29,a forest fire?
4,116,00:08:30,it's too well-timed to be a coincidence.
4,117,00:08:32,it was clearly raised in response to our smoke.
4,118,00:08:36,you mean...
4,119,00:08:37,yeah.
4,120,00:08:40,this is exhilarating.
4,121,00:08:44,there's someone else in this stone world.
4,122,00:08:49,more people?
4,123,00:08:52,we have to finish putting out the fire.
4,124,00:08:55,"oh, that's right."
4,125,00:08:57,"no, hang on."
4,126,00:08:59,"as far as they know, that explosion could have been from a volcano."
4,127,00:09:04,we need to signal them even more before they leave.
4,128,00:09:08,i see!
4,129,00:09:10,but if tsukasa-kun is after us...
4,130,00:09:13,we'll be doing him the courtesy of letting him know where we are.
4,131,00:09:19,"the least logical part of me, my gut, is talking to me."
4,132,00:09:23,if we start a fire now...
4,133,00:09:26,which do i choose? safety?
4,134,00:09:29,the future?
4,135,00:09:30,"what do we do, senku?"
4,136,00:09:32,put it out?
4,137,00:09:33,or light it?
4,138,00:09:37,light it!
4,139,00:09:38,fire the smoke signal!
4,140,00:09:53,we're running out of gunpowder.
4,141,00:09:55,throw in anything that'll burn!
4,142,00:09:57,hang on! i'll go get some wood!
4,143,00:10:00,it's a double-edged smoke signal.
4,144,00:10:02,we're letting everyone in the vicinity know where we are.
4,145,00:10:05,if tsukasa knows about our plan to make gunpowder...
4,146,00:10:09,senku is trying to make gunpowder.
4,147,00:10:12,the shells told me as much.
4,148,00:10:15,there are four insanely useful ways to use it.
4,149,00:10:20,didn't i say three?
4,150,00:10:22,senku hid one because he thought i could be a threat.
4,151,00:10:26,which means...
4,152,00:10:28,the fourth important use for sea shells is
4,153,00:10:31,weapons of science.
4,154,00:10:33,it's easy to imagine.
4,155,00:10:34,"for example,"
4,156,00:10:35,"mass production of potassium nitrate, which is used in gunpowder."
4,157,00:10:41,that's it.
4,158,00:10:42,senku was already thinking ahead
4,159,00:10:44,to a future in which he'd use gunpowder to fight me.
4,160,00:11:12,"""if weapons of science enter the scene,"
4,161,00:11:14,"i won't be the most powerful anymore."""
4,162,00:11:18,"you look like you're about to throw a tantrum, tsukasa."
4,163,00:11:24,you could put it that way.
4,164,00:11:28,"if you make weapons of science and revive the older generations,"
4,165,00:11:33,"they'll begin fighting over established interests,"
4,166,00:11:36,and we'll be right back in a tainted world.
4,167,00:11:40,i don't mind getting my hands dirty in order to stop that.
4,168,00:11:46,"so now you have to kill science man senku here, huh?"
4,169,00:11:52,america would be moved to tearsby your merciful death sentence.
4,170,00:11:56,"yeah. but first,"
4,171,00:11:58,would you mind giving me the recipe for the petrification revival fluid?
4,172,00:12:08,"sorry, but i'm not as merciful as you are."
4,173,00:12:11,i can only look at things logically.
4,174,00:12:15,i don't care one millimeter what you do with that woman.
4,175,00:12:19,there are plenty of females around—
4,176,00:12:27,"don't try to negotiate, senku."
4,177,00:12:30,you never buried yuzuriha.
4,178,00:12:34,your best move would have been to bury yuzuriha somewhere
4,179,00:12:37,far away while she was petrified.
4,180,00:12:40,"that way, she'd never be taken hostage."
4,181,00:12:43,there's no way you couldn't have thought of something that even i did.
4,182,00:12:48,but you didn't do it.
4,183,00:12:50,was it for taiju? or for yuzuriha?
4,184,00:12:54,"no, it was for both of them."
4,185,00:13:01,"you call yourself logical, but you have friends that are precious to you."
4,186,00:13:06,"i have plenty of admirers, but i have no one i'd call precious."
4,187,00:13:13,"that's why i win, senku."
4,188,00:13:18,i actually appreciate that.
4,189,00:13:20,washing my hair is a pain in this world.
4,190,00:13:30,"don't tell him, senku-kun."
4,191,00:13:33,"so long as he doesn't have the recipe for the revival fluid,"
4,192,00:13:36,tsukasa-kun can't kill you.
4,193,00:13:43,i don't mind.
4,194,00:13:46,but you have to survive so that you can secure everyone's future.
4,195,00:14:06,the revival fluid is a compound of nitric acid and alcohol.
4,196,00:14:14,"filter the miracle water from the cave,"
4,197,00:14:17,and mix it with alcohol that's been distilled
4,198,00:14:20,up to as close to 96% as you can get it.
4,199,00:14:23,the ratio is 30% miracle water to 70% alcohol.
4,200,00:14:26,"if you're off by so much as a few percent, the reaction won't happen,"
4,201,00:14:30,so fine-tune it using a petrified swallow feather.
4,202,00:14:38,"thank you, senku."
4,203,00:14:42,i no longer have a reason to let you live.
4,204,00:14:51,this should be enough.
4,205,00:14:57,three smoke signals!
4,206,00:15:00,they must be responding to the three shots we fired with the gunpowder!
4,207,00:15:04,there's no mistake!
4,208,00:15:05,there are people!
4,209,00:15:07,senku!
4,210,00:15:09,yuzuriha!
4,211,00:15:17,three.
4,212,00:15:27,"if i let you live,"
4,213,00:15:30,you would let civilization develop.
4,214,00:15:34,will you promise that you won't do that?
4,215,00:15:39,what the hell are you talking about?
4,216,00:15:40,why would i ever keep a promise like—
4,217,00:15:42,"no, you would never lie."
4,218,00:15:45,not to science.
4,219,00:15:49,"will you promise here and now, for all eternity, that you'll abandon science?"
4,220,00:15:59,"if you do, i won't have to kill you, senku."
4,221,00:16:13,"all right, next is senku-kun."
4,222,00:16:16,i'm going to space.
4,223,00:16:18,an astronaut!
4,224,00:16:18,{\an8}what i want to become
4,225,00:16:20,that's a great dream.
4,226,00:16:22,"well, when you grow up..."
4,227,00:16:24,"no, i'm going immediately."
4,228,00:16:29,"then again, i'm just a kid who doesn't know the first thing about science."
4,229,00:16:33,i'm going to study
4,230,00:16:36,every last thing.
4,231,00:16:39,i'm going to try everything.
4,232,00:16:47,i can't help you.
4,233,00:16:49,"but, senku, if you're serious,"
4,234,00:16:53,you can accomplish anything through diligent application of science.
4,235,00:16:56,{\an8}used cars
4,236,00:16:59,i'm sure santa claus will give you the tools you need.
4,237,00:17:15,you can burn things with the point of light from a magnifying glass.
4,238,00:17:19,what an adorable experiment.
4,239,00:17:26,sand iron and aluminum foil are awesome!
4,240,00:17:29,the frying pan is melting from the thermite reaction.
4,241,00:17:32,adorable...?
4,242,00:17:38,"the liquid oxygen for the injector boils off ten billion percent at a normal temperature,"
4,243,00:17:43,and it freezes when it's too cold.
4,244,00:17:45,i'll have to keep trying with ethanol for a while until i switch to kerosene.
4,245,00:18:16,what's that?
4,246,00:18:17,it's an ablator.
4,247,00:18:18,the chamber will burn out if i don't use it.
4,248,00:18:23,hello.
4,249,00:18:25,"i need a raspberry pi, a transmitter module, and this thing called a ""gyro."""
4,250,00:18:45,we'll use a good old yagi antenna for the receiver.
4,251,00:18:48,it's what they'd use for tvs.
4,252,00:18:57,senku!
4,253,00:18:58,"you said you'd try it with a light payload, right?"
4,254,00:19:02,i had ogawa yuzuriha-san of the crafts club make us three passengers.
4,255,00:19:10,"it's seriously embarrassing, having a doll of myself."
4,256,00:19:13,what are you even using these for?
4,257,00:19:57,it blew up at a really high altitude.
4,258,00:19:59,failed again?!
4,259,00:20:02,not entirely.
4,260,00:20:11,i'm going to space.
4,261,00:20:14,i'm going immediately.
4,262,00:20:17,you can accomplish anything through diligent application of science.
4,263,00:20:25,"senku, i'd rather notkill you if i can help it."
4,264,00:20:31,i'll ask you again.
4,265,00:20:34,"will you promise me, here and now, that you'll abandon science?"
4,266,00:20:42,i can't do that.
4,267,00:20:51,i thought that would be your answer.
4,268,00:20:56,what are you babbling about?
4,269,00:20:58,"you were going to kill me at some point, no matter how i'd answered."
4,270,00:21:03,to be on the safe side.
4,271,00:21:05,perhaps.
4,272,00:21:09,do it in one blow.
4,273,00:21:11,making me bleed out forever wouldn't be logical for either of us.
4,274,00:21:17,don't worry.
4,275,00:21:19,i'll bust your cervical nerve in a single blow.

4,277,00:21:24,i won't make you suffer.
4,278,00:21:26,i promise not to miss.
4,279,00:21:30,taiju-kun...
4,280,00:21:34,yuzuriha...
4,281,00:21:35,senku!
4,282,00:21:40,"senku, if we'd met 3,700 years ago..."
4,283,00:21:47,if we'd met before this planet became a stone world...
4,284,00:21:56,you may have been my first friend.
4,285,00:22:00,maybe.
4,286,00:22:10,senku!

5,1,00:00:11,"if i let you live,"
5,2,00:00:15,you would let civilization develop.
5,3,00:00:18,will you promise that you won't do that?
5,4,00:00:23,what the hell are you talking about?
5,5,00:00:25,why would i ever keep a promise like—
5,6,00:00:27,"no, you would never lie."
5,7,00:00:30,not to science.
5,8,00:00:34,"will you promise here and now, for all eternity, that you'll abandon science?"
5,9,00:00:44,"if you do, i won't have to kill you, senku."
5,10,00:00:54,i can't do that.
5,11,00:01:03,i thought that would be your answer.
5,12,00:01:08,do it in one blow.
5,13,00:01:09,making me bleed out forever wouldn't be logical for either of us.
5,14,00:01:15,don't worry.
5,15,00:01:17,i'll bust your cervical nerve in a single blow.
5,16,00:01:20,"you'll be knocked unconscious instantly, and then you'll die."
5,17,00:01:23,i won't make you suffer.
5,18,00:01:25,i promise not to miss.
5,19,00:01:29,taiju-kun...
5,20,00:01:32,yuzuriha...
5,21,00:01:34,senku!
5,22,00:01:36,"senku, if we'd met 3,700 years ago..."
5,23,00:01:59,if we'd met before this planet became a stone world...
5,24,00:02:09,you may have been my first friend.
5,25,00:02:28,senku!
5,26,00:04:15,senku!
5,27,00:04:19,answer me!
5,28,00:04:20,"answer me, please!"
5,29,00:04:22,no!
5,30,00:04:24,this is wrong!
5,31,00:04:25,it can't be!
5,32,00:04:26,"you can't die here, senku!"
5,33,00:04:31,there's no way!
5,34,00:04:34,he didn't suffer.
5,35,00:04:36,"i suggest that, as his friends, you give him a proper farewell."
5,36,00:04:51,"so long as yuzuriha could be used as a hostage, taiju would never attack me."
5,37,00:04:57,that was the power dynamic.
5,38,00:05:01,"but, taiju, if senku's death were to enrage you"
5,39,00:05:05,and drive you to attack me mindlessly...
5,40,00:05:10,"i'd have to kill you, too."
5,41,00:05:13,please don't lose your head.
5,42,00:05:38,taiju-kun!
5,43,00:05:40,"don't worry, yuzuriha."
5,44,00:05:44,i'm calm.
5,45,00:05:48,it seems i have no choice but to fight him.
5,46,00:05:53,"sorry, yuzuriha. if it comes to it..."
5,47,00:05:58,"it's okay, taiju-kun."
5,48,00:06:02,the three of us made a promise.
5,49,00:06:06,i'm sure it'll work out.
5,50,00:06:07,it has to.
5,51,00:06:13,yeah.
5,52,00:06:14,"thanks, yuzuriha!"
5,53,00:06:26,why did he throw it in the air?
5,54,00:06:31,the boulder is a decoy.
5,55,00:06:34,"taiju, i can see you."
5,56,00:06:37,"no matter what you do, you've lost."
5,57,00:06:40,tsukasa is wary of me.
5,58,00:06:42,he wouldn't dare take his eyes off me.
5,59,00:06:46,but that's when i have my chance!
5,60,00:06:52,tsukasa-kun's instincts would tell him that taiju-kun would protect me.
5,61,00:06:57,"i think he's right, in this stone world."
5,62,00:07:03,but like senku-kun said...
5,63,00:07:09,science levels the playing field for everyone!
5,64,00:07:26,it's black powder.
5,65,00:07:28,senku-kun left us...
5,66,00:07:31,...with science to remember him by.
5,67,00:07:34,the three of us made a promise to fight together.
5,68,00:07:42,"yuzuriha, senku, and i..."
5,69,00:07:48,fight alongside each other in this battle!
5,70,00:07:54,"goodbye, tsukasa!"
5,71,00:08:41,taiju would never attack anyone.
5,72,00:08:44,he wouldn't have expected me to take so much as a scrape from that.
5,73,00:08:50,"goodbye, tsukasa!"
5,74,00:08:55,i see.
5,75,00:09:02,"that's right, senku. you said it yourself!"
5,76,00:09:06,"if we need to run, we're running together!"
5,77,00:09:09,i don't care what anyone says.
5,78,00:09:10,i know you aren't dead!
5,79,00:09:14,you wouldn't die while you still have the goal of restarting civilization from scratch!
5,80,00:09:27,what's the point of fleeing?
5,81,00:09:32,i shattered his cervical nerve for sure.
5,82,00:09:40,"there's no way to revive him, especially in this stone world, with no medicine."
5,83,00:09:46,heart massage...
5,84,00:09:48,i don't even know if i'm doing it right.
5,85,00:09:50,but i have to do it.
5,86,00:09:54,"wait, artificial respiration?"
5,87,00:09:59,i think you should keep his neck still!
5,88,00:10:02,tsukasa-kun hit him in the neck.
5,89,00:10:05,senku-kun sacrificed himself for me.
5,90,00:10:13,senku sacrificed himself for you?
5,91,00:10:16,magic psychologyasagiri gen
5,92,00:10:18,here's a psychology quiz.
5,93,00:10:20,"suppose there's an accident,"
5,94,00:10:21,"and only you, your friend, or your lover can be saved."
5,95,00:10:26,what would you do?
5,96,00:10:28,i think i'd get stuck trying to decide between my friend and my lover.
5,97,00:10:31,wouldn't you obviously choose yourself?
5,98,00:10:33,how could you ever choose?
5,99,00:10:35,what kind of nasty quiz is that?
5,100,00:10:38,i'd say everyone.
5,101,00:10:41,i'd look for a fundamental rule that lets us all be saved.
5,102,00:10:47,wow! just the kind of thing a science club president would say.
5,103,00:10:51,"wait, that's allowed?"
5,104,00:10:53,"that's my choice, too, then!"
5,105,00:10:55,this psych quiz tells you who is the most important to you.
5,106,00:10:59,that's ten billion percent obvious.
5,107,00:11:01,that book's absolute trash.
5,108,00:11:06,senku would never kill himself.
5,109,00:11:09,"he'd never sacrifice himself, either."
5,110,00:11:11,he would have bet on some way we'd all be saved.
5,111,00:11:14,try to remember about senku.
5,112,00:11:17,we're his friends. we'd know.
5,113,00:11:20,there must be a hint!
5,114,00:11:26,his neck...
5,115,00:11:29,i think senku-kun was deliberately inviting tsukasa-kun to attack his neck.
5,116,00:11:39,that thing he was doing...
5,117,00:11:42,that's not a habit he's always had.
5,118,00:11:45,why did he keep touching his neck and cracking it like that?
5,119,00:11:52,there's a little bit of petrification left on his neck!
5,120,00:11:57,"when we were removing the petrification on your foot, didn't senku say..."
5,121,00:12:04,that small breaks are repaired when the petrification is undone?
5,122,00:12:10,"taiju-kun, the revival fluid!"
5,123,00:12:12,yeah!
5,124,00:12:16,"it might work on senku-kun's neck, too."
5,125,00:12:21,it might fix his neck when the petrification is undone.
5,126,00:12:39,the petrification's gone!
5,127,00:12:44,wake up!
5,128,00:12:45,i know you wouldn't die in a place like this!
5,129,00:12:51,"senku, you're..."
5,130,00:12:55,"the star of hope for humanity, for civilization!"
5,131,00:13:01,please!
5,132,00:13:03,come back!
5,133,00:13:04,"wake up, senku!"
5,134,00:13:27,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..."
5,135,00:13:39,all right.
5,136,00:13:41,"i can make it past 800,000 seconds without nearly losing consciousness now."
5,137,00:13:46,my brain's getting used to this.
5,138,00:13:51,"i've been frozen like this for117,354,889,550 seconds now."
5,139,00:14:02,"in other words, it's the 3,718th spring."
5,140,00:14:08,starting in the spring is an absolute must if i'm going to be revived.
5,141,00:14:14,"all right, if i'm going to get up, now's the time."
5,142,00:14:18,"get up already, me."
5,143,00:14:21,get up!
5,144,00:14:23,"get up, damn it!"
5,145,00:14:25,get up!
5,146,00:14:27,get up!
5,147,00:14:46,i broke out!
5,148,00:14:49,"i'd love to be that boisterous, but..."
5,149,00:14:55,i'm ten billion percent sure i would've done that if i were a simpleton like taiju.
5,150,00:15:01,my first priority is to secure my surroundings.
5,151,00:15:04,my own body is a hint that's worth its weight in gold.
5,152,00:15:11,"the location where i was lying down, my position..."
5,153,00:15:15,the order in which the mystery stone fragments fell off of me...
5,154,00:15:20,i'm going to keep every last piece for when i'm ready to investigate.
5,155,00:15:29,"yo, where you from?"
5,156,00:15:31,"where are you from, monkey?"
5,157,00:15:40,"dude, he's all shiny!"
5,158,00:15:42,gross!
5,159,00:15:43,that monkey's got shiny skin!
5,160,00:15:45,"he's got his nasty peepee out, too!"
5,161,00:15:48,"so do i, actually."
5,162,00:15:49,gross!
5,163,00:15:54,am i the first one they've seen?
5,164,00:16:02,it doesn't look like civilization survived.
5,165,00:16:06,which means i'm the first shiny monkey to be born on this planet.
5,166,00:16:15,this is exhilarating.
5,167,00:16:25,"it's been 117,354,893,870 seconds since i was petrified."
5,168,00:16:33,the mental arithmetic is getting hard.
5,169,00:16:36,the leap seconds are a pain in the ass.
5,170,00:16:39,"not to mention, earth is rotating"
5,171,00:16:41,seventeen millionths of a second slower every year.
5,172,00:16:45,little numbers don't mean anything.

5,174,00:16:49,"ad 5738, april 1st."
5,175,00:16:54,today is year zero.
5,176,00:16:57,it all starts here.
5,177,00:17:10,take a look at the power of the shiny monkey.
5,178,00:17:13,i'm going to build a civilization with enough technology to take us to space.
5,179,00:17:31,he's been rubbing that stick this whole time.
5,180,00:17:33,that shiny monkey's a dumb-dumb.
5,181,00:17:36,let's go home.
5,182,00:17:37,what a moron.
5,183,00:17:46,i'm neither a meathead like taiju
5,184,00:17:49,nor an ultra-dexterous craft club kid like yuzuriha.
5,185,00:17:52,there's no way i'm going to start a fire
5,186,00:17:55,using a primitive hand drill in japan's humidity.
5,187,00:18:05,that's right.
5,188,00:18:07,this shiny monkey has neither fangs nor claws.
5,189,00:18:11,"all i can do is improvise, one step at a time."
5,190,00:18:15,that's exactly what civilization is.
5,191,00:18:28,why does he keep banging the rock like that?
5,192,00:18:31,that shiny monkey's definitely a dumb-dumb.
5,193,00:18:39,there's some trick to it that i'll only learn through trial and error.
5,194,00:18:43,bash the edges off mid-air.
5,195,00:18:47,sharpen both sides of the edge by striking it on top of a surface.
5,196,00:18:53,"i have to use the right kind of rock for the job, too."
5,197,00:18:56,"this colorful rock, chert, is tough as hell."
5,198,00:19:00,nothing will work better for making a small knife.
5,199,00:19:04,learn everything.
5,200,00:19:06,try everything.
5,201,00:19:13,{\an4}\h\h\hshiny monkey\h\h\hacquired\h\h\hstone tools!!
5,202,00:19:22,i can unravel this like string cheese.
5,203,00:19:31,now he's twisting it.
5,204,00:19:33,"i bet his brain is shiny, too."
5,205,00:19:40,{\an4}\h\h\hshiny monkey\h\h\hacquired\h\h\hrope!!
5,206,00:19:46,there are actually quite a few animals that use tools.
5,207,00:19:51,"crows, otters, and orangutans, for example."
5,208,00:19:56,but there's only one species that uses science.
5,209,00:20:03,generating heat by using the oxidation of the gases given off by cellulose...
5,210,00:20:07,in other words...
5,211,00:20:12,combustion!
5,212,00:20:16,{\an4}\h\h\hshiny monkey\h\h\hacquired\h\h\hfire!!
5,213,00:20:51,i use ingenuity to take in everything the universe has to offer.
5,214,00:21:01,i'm the master of science!
5,215,00:21:47,i guess i haven't introduced myself yet.
5,216,00:21:50,nice to meet you.
5,217,00:21:54,what the hell is that?!
5,218,00:21:56,the shiny monkey isn't shiny anymore!
5,219,00:22:00,i'm the only one of my kind on this planet...
5,220,00:22:06,a human.
5,221,00:22:07,"{\an4}acquired food,clothing and shelter!!"
5,222,00:22:11,"i'm going to build a technological civilization from scratch,"

6,1,00:00:22,it's finally starting to look like a real human dwelling.
6,2,00:00:27,"now, then..."
6,3,00:00:29,i don't think i can keep hitting the ignore button on my exhaustion anymore.
6,4,00:00:39,damn it! a human being on his own can barely make it through the day.
6,5,00:00:43,never mind science and progress.
6,6,00:00:47,if only i had one more person with a lot of strength...
6,7,00:00:57,i've already had my eye on this one.
6,8,00:00:59,"right by where i was revived,"
6,9,00:01:02,i'd seen the uncannily masculine hand of a guy who'd been swept here
6,10,00:01:06,from the same direction as me.
6,11,00:01:17,although i've already seen more of this face than i ever wanted to...
6,12,00:01:21,"it's been 3,700 years, huh?"
6,13,00:01:25,"hey, big oaf."
6,14,00:01:28,"now, then..."
6,15,00:01:29,time to get started on the senku laboratory.
6,16,00:01:32,"yo, big oaf."
6,17,00:01:34,what will it take for you to wake up like i did?
6,18,00:01:38,"what exactly was it that petrified all of humanity 3,700 years ago?"
6,19,00:01:45,alien technological attack hypothesis
6,20,00:01:46,number one...
6,21,00:01:47,"dude, earthlings are so lame."
6,22,00:01:49,let's turn them all into stone.
6,23,00:01:52,it did work on the swallows.
6,24,00:01:54,petrification beam!
6,25,00:01:56,"lawl, this is exhilarating!"
6,26,00:01:58,some nation's military weapon hypothesis
6,27,00:01:59,number two...
6,28,00:02:02,the petrification device is finally complete!
6,29,00:02:07,"oh, crap! it backfired!"
6,30,00:02:10,{\an1}newvirusstrainhypothesis
6,31,00:02:11,number three...
6,32,00:02:14,we're petrification viruses!
6,33,00:02:16,we infect only humans and swallows!
6,34,00:02:19,"rofl, this is exhilarating!"
6,35,00:02:24,the only thing that's certain
6,36,00:02:26,is that it targeted humans and swallows specifically.
6,37,00:02:31,"it seems like some kind of insane fantasy, but there must be some underlying rule."
6,38,00:02:35,which means i can fight it.
6,39,00:02:38,figuring out the rules is the basis of science.
6,40,00:02:42,i'm standing in the face of an uncharted branch of science.
6,41,00:02:49,this is exhilarating.
6,42,00:02:52,"now, think."
6,43,00:02:54,how did i get out of my petrification?
6,44,00:02:57,was it just simple deterioration?
6,45,00:02:59,"if it was deterioration, wouldn't the exposed surface have broken down first?"
6,46,00:03:07,but the stone statues are stone all the way through.
6,47,00:03:11,"for me,"
6,48,00:03:12,the surface stayed stone while the rest of me changed back into living cells.
6,49,00:03:17,it's the other way around!
6,50,00:03:19,the surface was too deteriorated to revert to living cells.
6,51,00:03:22,that's why it turned into a stone husk.
6,52,00:03:25,the parts of the surface that happened to be less petrified reverted to cells.
6,53,00:03:30,that must be why there are pieces missing from the shell.
6,54,00:03:34,so i wasn't revived because of deterioration.
6,55,00:03:39,"there's some special, outside factor."
6,56,00:03:42,the fragments closest to my head were on the ground in a pile.
6,57,00:03:47,which means the revival started from my head.
6,58,00:03:55,there's something in there.
6,59,00:04:09,this smell...
6,60,00:04:11,nitric acid!
6,61,00:04:14,the hair on the back of my neck is still petrified.
6,62,00:04:20,let's try it on this stone hair.
6,63,00:05:08,why did only i need nitric acid?
6,64,00:05:12,it's not working one millimeter on taiju or the others.
6,65,00:05:17,why?
6,66,00:05:18,what's the difference between me and the rest of them?
6,67,00:05:23,think...
6,68,00:05:25,i just need a hypothesis.
6,69,00:05:27,think.
6,70,00:05:29,think...
6,71,00:05:31,that's it! i was thinking!
6,72,00:05:35,"i stayed conscious for all 3,700 years."
6,73,00:05:40,the brain burns through 400 calories in a day.
6,74,00:05:44,"over 3,700 years, that works out to 2 terajoules."
6,75,00:05:49,where did all that energy come from?
6,76,00:05:52,e=mc².
6,77,00:05:55,energy and mass have equivalent exchange.
6,78,00:05:59,it's the foundation of science that old man einstein derived.
6,79,00:06:03,there's simply no way to make energy from nothing.
6,80,00:06:07,there's something in the stone that i was consuming in order to use my brain.
6,81,00:06:12,"which means if i can figure out what that was, i can undo the petrification."
6,82,00:06:17,try everything.
6,83,00:06:19,just try it.
6,84,00:06:22,"i really want to try nital, the industrial etching solution."
6,85,00:06:28,damn it.
6,86,00:06:29,too bad i don't have alcohol.
6,87,00:06:32,{\an8}laboratory
6,88,00:06:32,believe.
6,89,00:06:34,"try, try, try, try, try, try..."
6,90,00:06:40,and try some more.
6,91,00:06:45,never forget.
6,92,00:06:47,"petrification may be a fantasy,"
6,93,00:06:52,but the foundations of science are absolute.
6,94,00:07:02,i need more manpower.
6,95,00:07:05,"take the nitric acid and wake up already, you blockhead!"
6,96,00:07:11,"you're awake, aren't you?"
6,97,00:07:13,"you've been awake for the past 3,700 years!"
6,98,00:07:15,you're no different from me.
6,99,00:07:18,you don't know when to give up!
6,100,00:07:24,senku! i...
6,101,00:07:27,taiju...
6,102,00:07:29,i'll believe in you and wait for as long as it takes.
6,103,00:07:29,{\an8}i'll believe in you and wait for as long as it takes.
6,104,00:07:32,i'm hopeless without you!
6,105,00:07:32,{\an8}i'm hopeless without you!
6,106,00:07:36,"come back, taiju!"
6,107,00:07:37,"come back, senku!"
6,108,00:08:21,it stopped raining.
6,109,00:08:25,the thunderstorm that was keeping us camouflaged is gone.
6,110,00:08:29,don't raise your voices.
6,111,00:08:31,"if tsukasa hears us, we'll be instantly screwed."
6,112,00:08:35,you're right!
6,113,00:08:36,"he's not coming, is he?"
6,114,00:08:49,i'm impressed you noticed my neck.
6,115,00:08:52,i hardly gave you a speck of a hint.
6,116,00:08:55,"taiju, yuzuriha, you both get ten billion points."
6,117,00:10:33,{\an8}two nations of the stone world
6,118,00:10:42,sen...
6,119,00:10:43,...ku...
6,120,00:10:48,"never mind my cervical nerve, you just crushed my entire body!"
6,121,00:10:52,i'll kill you!
6,122,00:10:59,"i'm sure you know not to, but don't go thanking me for every little thing."
6,123,00:11:05,"i won't thank you, either."
6,124,00:11:10,"welcome back, senku-kun."
6,125,00:11:19,don't you think the shape on this hide kind of looks like a rocket?
6,126,00:11:22,"there are star-looking things, too!"
6,127,00:11:24,they don't look anything like it.
6,128,00:11:26,it looks like a science flag. i bet it'll look good on senku-kun.
6,129,00:11:29,"let's put it on his neck, just in case."
6,130,00:11:31,"oh, yeah!"
6,131,00:11:32,it'll be even better with a splint. see?
6,132,00:11:35,"uh, i really don't need this."
6,133,00:11:37,i'm all better now.
6,134,00:11:40,professor senku's self-sacrificing human experiment was a success.
6,135,00:11:44,the restorative effects of undoing petrification are too damn high.
6,136,00:11:50,"the petrification that's given us so much grief is what cured you, too, huh?"
6,137,00:11:55,"you said it when we made soap, too..."
6,138,00:11:58,but maybe this petrification is the stone of life that replaces doctors for us.
6,139,00:12:03,it's doctor stone!
6,140,00:12:15,"come to think of it, it's weird."
6,141,00:12:18,"when the petrification is undone, it repairs everything around it, too."
6,142,00:12:22,what a consideratescientific phenomenon.
6,143,00:12:27,i've been thinking this whole time...
6,144,00:12:30,who petrified humanity?
6,145,00:12:33,who attacked us?
6,146,00:12:36,no...
6,147,00:12:37,was it really even an attack?
6,148,00:12:46,"if it can fix senku-kun's neck,"
6,149,00:12:49,maybe if we piece together
6,150,00:12:51,"the shattered statues and pour revival fluid on them, it'll put people back together."
6,151,00:12:56,i tried that right at the beginning.
6,152,00:12:57,they just went back to being a shattered corpse.
6,153,00:13:01,why wouldn't it work if it's so regenerative?
6,154,00:13:08,yuzuriha...
6,155,00:13:11,taiju's ten billion percent too crude for this.
6,156,00:13:14,you're our ultra-skillful crafts club member.
6,157,00:13:19,it'll be a grueling mission.
6,158,00:13:21,can you do it?
6,159,00:13:34,that really is really grueling.
6,160,00:13:37,but i'll do it!
6,161,00:13:40,that was quick.
6,162,00:13:41,craft is all about perseverance!
6,163,00:13:43,are you sharing secrets?
6,164,00:13:46,no fair! let me in on it!
6,165,00:13:49,"i, um... was saying maybe we should go see tsukasa-kun."
6,166,00:13:54,"oh, yeah?"
6,167,00:13:56,"tsukasa's place, huh?"
6,168,00:13:58,what?!
6,169,00:13:59,why?!
6,170,00:14:01,he's the dangerous man that killed senku!
6,171,00:14:03,"i mean, he's not dead, and he was a good guy, but..."
6,172,00:14:08,"at the very least, he thought he'd killed senku!"
6,173,00:14:12,that's exactly what we accomplished in that fight.
6,174,00:14:17,tsukasa thinks i'm in the afterlife now.
6,175,00:14:21,"meanwhile, i can always know where tsukasa is."
6,176,00:14:25,"we'll have a giant advantage in this battle,"
6,177,00:14:28,if you two can infiltrate the tsukasa empire as spies.
6,178,00:14:36,i gave yuzuriha the details about the mission.
6,179,00:14:39,"taiju, you protect yuzuriha."
6,180,00:14:42,blockheads like you are better off not knowing everything.
6,181,00:14:46,"all right, i got it."
6,182,00:14:47,i'll do it.
6,183,00:14:49,"tsukasa intends to use the miracle water,"
6,184,00:14:53,"revival fluid, to amass an army of young people to make a new world ruled by military might."
6,185,00:14:59,in order to defeat the tsukasa empire
6,186,00:15:02,and stop the mass destruction that is the purification of humanity...
6,187,00:15:07,we'll have to make a revolutionary army that can combat them using science.
6,188,00:15:11,but how are you going to do that on your own?
6,189,00:15:14,yeah.
6,190,00:15:16,"if tsukasa has the miracle water, the nitric acid, you can't make gunpowder,"
6,191,00:15:21,and you can't grow your manpower.
6,192,00:15:25,the answer is obvious.
6,193,00:15:29,i'm going to find the mystery people who fired the smoke signals
6,194,00:15:32,and get them on my side.
6,195,00:15:36,the problem is that they might encounter tsukasa first.
6,196,00:15:42,i'll just have to bet on the chance that they haven't.
6,197,00:15:46,"so, going forward, the two of us will be spies in the tsukasa empire."
6,198,00:15:51,you'll be finding allies for a scientific revolutionary army.
6,199,00:15:55,and we'll each be fighting our own battles.
6,200,00:16:00,that's the idea.
6,201,00:16:02,i'm getting all teary-eyed thinking about our sad goodbye.
6,202,00:16:09,you're both so casual about this.
6,203,00:16:12,"guys really are stoic with each other, huh?"
6,204,00:16:15,yeah.
6,205,00:16:16,senku is always logical.
6,206,00:16:19,we won't be seeing each other for a while.
6,207,00:16:22,"not for weeks, months, maybe even..."
6,208,00:16:44,senku!
6,209,00:16:46,i promise—
6,210,00:16:47,"wait, i can't raise my voice."
6,211,00:17:10,hang in there for the short while that i'm gone.
6,212,00:17:13,"hey, you've been waiting 3,700 years."
6,213,00:17:17,a few more months or years is no big deal.
6,214,00:17:25,we're going to build our kingdom of science.
6,215,00:17:48,"rear right, 57 meters."
6,216,00:17:51,"yes, you, the one who's been following me quietly for the past two minutes."
6,217,00:17:56,who are you?
6,218,00:18:09,blue eyes.
6,219,00:18:10,she's young.
6,220,00:18:12,did taiju and the others just revive her?
6,221,00:18:15,or are there other ways for people to be revived?
6,222,00:18:33,"now, that's not nice."
6,223,00:18:35,"shouldn't you say ""nice to meet you"" first?"
6,224,00:18:38,shut your mouth!
6,225,00:18:39,save your introductions for hell.
6,226,00:18:56,impossible.
6,227,00:18:58,she's too young to have such skill.
6,228,00:19:00,there's no way the martial arts community wouldn't have heard of her.
6,229,00:19:03,who is she?
6,230,00:19:05,i saw everything!
6,231,00:19:07,"you took a woman hostage,"
6,232,00:19:08,and then you ruthlessly killed the gentleman who took the hit for her.
6,233,00:19:14,"i couldn't hear what you were talking about,"
6,234,00:19:16,but i have no interest in your background.
6,235,00:19:20,repent to the sorcerer gentleman until your soul rots away!
6,236,00:19:29,sorcerer?
6,237,00:19:32,"you were just bathed in it moments ago, and you've forgotten already?"
6,238,00:19:35,you were summoning the mountain's wrath with your suspicious black powder!
6,239,00:19:39,the mountain's wrath?
6,240,00:19:42,a volcanic eruption?
6,241,00:19:46,"so you may not be one of the revived, but rather, one of their children."
6,242,00:19:53,or...
6,243,00:19:55,what generation are you?
6,244,00:20:00,"she's of a pure, primitivepeople with no science."
6,245,00:20:04,i could rule over them easily.
6,246,00:20:06,i could kill them easily.
6,247,00:20:08,there's no reason to attack them.
6,248,00:20:12,thus my immediate goal is to return to the cave.
6,249,00:20:17,taiju and yuzuriha have seen how to make gunpowder.
6,250,00:20:21,i need to claim the miracle water before they do.
6,251,00:20:26,this is goodbye.
6,252,00:21:03,you're... the sorcerer gentleman who protected that woman.
6,253,00:21:08,you're alive!
6,254,00:21:09,stop talking.
6,255,00:21:11,you can introduce yourself all you want later.
6,256,00:21:14,don't waste your energy.
6,257,00:21:18,can you hold out until evening?
6,258,00:21:21,"if you're at your limit,"
6,259,00:21:23,i'll take a gamble and blow it up with the little gunpowder i have left.
6,260,00:21:26,"but if you can hold on,"
6,261,00:21:27,"it'll take forever, but i'll save you, ten billion percent."
6,262,00:21:32,you're the only one who can make the decision!
6,263,00:21:35,decide right now!
6,264,00:21:37,which is it?
6,265,00:21:41,"yeah, my organs and bones are all fine."
6,266,00:21:44,i can hold on.
6,267,00:21:59,i'd say the fallen tree weighs roughly one ton.
6,268,00:22:02,"to get it to one side would take half of that, 500 kilograms."
6,269,00:22:05,"assuming my own weight is just over 60 kilograms,"
6,270,00:22:08,multiplied by 2 to the 3rd power to get to 500 kilograms...
6,271,00:22:10,i can just barely make it with three.
6,272,00:22:16,the bamboo's barely strong enough.
6,273,00:22:19,i'll just have to pack them with dirt.
6,274,00:22:25,who would have thought that soap would be so useful now?
6,275,00:22:29,it's an all-star team of great professor senku's inventions.
6,276,00:22:37,what is this?
6,277,00:22:39,this is science.
6,278,00:22:41,it was invented by old man archimedes a few hundred years bc.
6,279,00:22:46,it converts the measly strength of a high school kid into herculean might.
6,280,00:22:51,it's called a pulley!
6,281,00:23:20,amazing.
6,282,00:23:23,"no, i'm not talking about that archi-whoever's wisdom."
6,283,00:23:28,i'm talking about your unwavering diligence in forcing yourself through every step
6,284,00:23:33,until you solve a problem.
6,285,00:23:39,my name is kohaku.
6,286,00:23:41,it seems i've taken quite a liking to you.
6,287,00:23:54,{\an8}two nations of the stone world
6,288,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
6,289,00:23:58,{\an8}where two million years have gone
6,290,00:24:00,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
7,1,00:00:07,amazing.
7,2,00:00:10,my name is kohaku.
7,3,00:00:13,it seems i've taken quite a liking to you.
7,4,00:00:24,i don't like what i just heard.
7,5,00:00:28,"we just met, and she's already in love?"
7,6,00:00:30,in this state of emergency?
7,7,00:00:32,i didn't say anything about that!
7,8,00:00:34,"i'm saying i like you as a person, so i'll cooperate with you!"
7,9,00:00:38,"oh, i appreciate that, then."
7,10,00:00:40,nothing is as illogical or trouble-prone as relationships.
7,11,00:00:55,"what are you, a new species of hominid that sleeps with a sword?"
7,12,00:00:58,it's because you started talking about relationships.
7,13,00:01:02,"i like the way you live, but i don't trust you yet."
7,14,00:01:06,"i take care of myself, and this habit is a result of that."
7,15,00:01:09,don't take it personally.
7,16,00:01:11,i'm not enough of a hero to assault a lioness willy-nilly.
7,17,00:01:14,hurry up and get some sleep.
7,18,00:01:16,lioness?!
7,19,00:01:17,"i have feelings, too, you know!"
7,20,00:01:19,"you live like a gentleman, but your foul mouth is of another dimension."
7,21,00:01:23,i think i might accidentally kill you someday.
7,22,00:01:25,then go to sleep before you cause any accidents.
7,23,00:01:28,i don't want to get killed twice in the same day.
7,24,00:01:34,"you're fighting against that long-haired man, aren't you?"
7,25,00:01:38,i'll help you.
7,26,00:01:40,"i can't just back down, either."
7,27,00:01:44,yeah.
7,28,00:01:46,that's why i'm making a nation of science.
7,29,00:01:49,"first of all, i need manpower."
7,30,00:01:52,so you want allies.
7,31,00:01:57,then why don't you come with me?
7,32,00:02:00,"you have more of your lion buddies, huh?"
7,33,00:02:04,yeah.
7,34,00:02:05,i'm sure they'll be dependable allies.
7,35,00:02:07,i know one man who'd be perfect.
7,36,00:02:10,"allow me to guide you, senku."
7,37,00:02:12,come with me.
7,38,00:03:45,{\an8}where two million years have gone
7,39,00:03:51,hot water?
7,40,00:03:53,yeah.
7,41,00:03:54,i take it home to make a hot spring bath.
7,42,00:03:58,for healing purposes.
7,43,00:04:00,you look like a ten billion percent healthy kid to me.
7,44,00:04:04,what use does a lively lioness like you have with any more healing?
7,45,00:04:08,i'm not a lioness!
7,46,00:04:10,and it's not for me! it's for my sister!
7,47,00:04:12,honestly...
7,48,00:04:14,she's such a troublesome nuisance of an older sister.
7,49,00:04:18,she's been especially sick lately.
7,50,00:04:21,if only i could swap her body with my exceedingly healthy one...
7,51,00:04:30,that jar looks like a little less than fifty liters.
7,52,00:04:34,it's not quite enough for a bath.
7,53,00:04:38,how many trips do you make with that heavy-ass jar?
7,54,00:04:42,every single day...
7,55,00:04:44,it's just part of my daily training.
7,56,00:04:47,"i'm a lot stronger thanks to it, too."
7,57,00:04:50,i should be grateful to my nuisance sis—
7,58,00:04:56,"you haven't fully recovered yet, have you?"
7,59,00:05:00,i can't have you overexerting yourself and dying on me.
7,60,00:05:03,hand it over.
7,61,00:05:05,senku...
7,62,00:05:09,you're the one overexerting yourself.
7,63,00:05:11,is everyone other than me in this stone world a gorilla?
7,64,00:05:16,"kohaku, tsukasa, taiju..."
7,65,00:05:18,gorilla?!
7,66,00:05:20,at least call me a lioness! that was better!
7,67,00:05:22,that's not the point here.
7,68,00:05:28,i'm impressed you built such a useful thing so quickly.
7,69,00:05:31,it wasn't quick.
7,70,00:05:33,i managed to use the pulleys from yesterday as wheels.
7,71,00:05:36,civilization births civilization.
7,72,00:05:39,applying developments is the basis of science.
7,73,00:05:42,turn right up there.
7,74,00:05:44,not that right!
7,75,00:05:50,"look, senku. there it is."
7,76,00:06:00,welcome to my village.
7,77,00:06:06,how many people do you have here?
7,78,00:06:08,"i don't remember how many retirees and children there are,"
7,79,00:06:11,"but aside from them, i think there are exactly forty."
7,80,00:06:14,forty...
7,81,00:06:19,kohaku and the rest of them
7,82,00:06:21,apparently don't know anything about modern technology.
7,83,00:06:23,so this is a settlement of revived people.
7,84,00:06:28,which means there must have been a first generation.
7,85,00:06:32,"for example, hundreds of years ago,"
7,86,00:06:35,there might've been a first-generation science man
7,87,00:06:38,like me who made revival fluid.
7,88,00:06:41,"there's no sign of revival fluid or any kind of science being passed down here, though."
7,89,00:06:48,where did these people come from?
7,90,00:07:02,"don't be violent, kinro, ginro."
7,91,00:07:05,this man saved my life.
7,92,00:07:07,"you can't do that, kohaku-chan."
7,93,00:07:09,that's not good.
7,94,00:07:11,outsiders aren't allowed here. that's a rule.
7,95,00:07:15,the chief's going to be angry with you.
7,96,00:07:17,it's a simple fact.
7,97,00:07:20,the rules are the rules.
7,98,00:07:22,there are no people outside the village.
7,99,00:07:24,all those outside are criminals who were banished before.
7,100,00:07:27,"therefore, i can't let you in."
7,101,00:07:30,"there's no room for consideration, even if he may have saved your life."
7,102,00:07:35,oh?
7,103,00:07:36,"you leave me no choice, then."
7,104,00:07:39,shall we fight here and now?
7,105,00:07:41,"oh, dear, it's two on one."
7,106,00:07:46,you clearly have an advantage.
7,107,00:07:52,you're so short-tempered.
7,108,00:07:55,and you make such a nasty face.
7,109,00:07:59,sorcery!
7,110,00:08:07,what is this?
7,111,00:08:09,what are these suspicious floating orbs?
7,112,00:08:15,"so that's the level you're at, huh?"
7,113,00:08:19,"i guess i'm taking all of this, then."
7,114,00:08:21,i'm going to get all forty of you on my side with science.
7,115,00:08:27,this is exhilarating.
7,116,00:08:30,you make such a nasty face.
7,117,00:08:32,"that's pretty sketchy, you know."
7,118,00:08:33,i can't stop them!
7,119,00:08:36,"the more i stab, the more appear."
7,120,00:08:38,"all right, then."
7,121,00:08:39,i'll have to use...
7,122,00:08:41,special technique: let someone else handle it!
7,123,00:08:41,{\an8}special technique:let someone else handle it!
7,124,00:08:44,"hey, chrome, it's sorcery!"
7,125,00:08:47,"quit freaking out, ginro."
7,126,00:08:50,i'm already here.
7,127,00:08:52,i saw these from the coast.
7,128,00:08:55,i'd be crazy not to come here right away.
7,129,00:08:59,hey!
7,130,00:09:00,i'm chrome.
7,131,00:09:01,"i'm an insanely smart, genius sorcerer!"
7,132,00:09:13,"looks like we won't have to go find him, senku."
7,133,00:09:17,this is the man i told you about yesterday.
7,134,00:09:20,"a sorcerer, huh?"
7,135,00:09:24,i'm senku.
7,136,00:09:25,i'm a scientist.
7,137,00:09:27,"don't let him scare you with his cheap sorcery, ginro, kinro."
7,138,00:09:32,you can make plenty of this stuff from coal suds.
7,139,00:09:38,i wasn't scared.
7,140,00:09:40,you're a fool if you aren't cautious of the unknown.
7,141,00:09:43,i was pretty scared.
7,142,00:09:46,"why are you here, chrome?"
7,143,00:09:48,"i have no interest in relying on your dubious, so-called ""sorcery."""
7,144,00:09:51,i don't care.
7,145,00:09:53,do as you like.
7,146,00:09:55,but this is one thing i'm not backing down on.
7,147,00:09:58,no one beats me in sorcery!
7,148,00:10:00,"don't get in my way, guys."
7,149,00:10:05,"if we fight here, the villagers could get caught up in it."
7,150,00:10:10,let's move elsewhere.
7,151,00:10:19,a sorcery battle? what are they going to do?
7,152,00:10:22,"they aren't going to burn everything to a crisp, are they?!"
7,153,00:10:25,stop it! nothing dangerous!
7,154,00:10:27,don't get us caught up in it!
7,155,00:10:33,check out my badass sorcery!
7,156,00:10:36,rainbow bridge!
7,157,00:10:38,{\an8}rainbow bridge
7,158,00:10:40,i am the master of flames!
7,159,00:10:44,the fire turned yellow!
7,160,00:10:46,how?!
7,161,00:10:49,it changed again!
7,162,00:10:51,to greenish-blue?
7,163,00:10:53,purple?!
7,164,00:10:55,amazing. this is...
7,165,00:10:57,...sorcery.
7,166,00:10:59,"rainbow bridge, my ass."
7,167,00:11:02,it's just a flame test reaction.
7,168,00:11:05,"you just threw salt, copper, and sulfur on it in that order."
7,169,00:11:09,what's the copper? copper sulfate or something?
7,170,00:11:13,i guess that doesn't help.
7,171,00:11:14,"it's the blue crystals you picked up in the caves, isn't it?"
7,172,00:11:21,"oh, shit!"
7,173,00:11:24,how the hell does he know about the blue crystals?!
7,174,00:11:27,"is he reading my mind? is that his sorcery? oh, shit!"
7,175,00:11:29,th-that's a thing?
7,176,00:11:31,"damn, nature, you're scary!"
7,177,00:11:33,"""oh, no, i'm scared! i'm running away!"""
7,178,00:11:36,was what i thought he'd say.
7,179,00:11:38,"""i'm defeated. please make me your apprentice,"""
7,180,00:11:40,was the other thing he'd want.
7,181,00:11:43,"i thought it would be one or the other, but oh, man!"
7,182,00:11:45,i was all worried that i wouldn't know what to do
7,183,00:11:47,if he wanted to become my apprentice!
7,184,00:11:52,you'd better not be thinking that
7,185,00:11:54,these cheap tricks are the only sorcery i've got!
7,186,00:11:58,i didn't say anything.
7,187,00:11:59,just wait right there!
7,188,00:12:02,i'm going to show you something that can actually be weaponized.
7,189,00:12:06,"this one's legit, trust me!"
7,190,00:12:08,he went to get something.
7,191,00:12:09,is that why he wanted to relocate?
7,192,00:12:11,so he needed his tools.
7,193,00:12:24,ouch!
7,194,00:12:26,what was that attack?!
7,195,00:12:31,"a ball of sulfur, huh?"
7,196,00:12:34,you put that sulfur you threw on the fire earlier into a pot
7,197,00:12:37,and melt it down with heat.
7,198,00:12:38,"once it cools and hardens, you crack the outer layer, and you're done."
7,199,00:12:42,that's a crazy way to make one of these things.
7,200,00:12:44,a sulfur ball static generator.
7,201,00:12:47,it's supposed to be a 17th century invention.
7,202,00:12:50,"you're exhilarating, chrome, you know that?"
7,203,00:12:54,rubbing it with leather instead of your hands will give you ten billion times more power.
7,204,00:12:58,this is my flag of science.
7,205,00:13:03,"{\an8}oh, crap!"
7,206,00:13:05,his head's all spiky!
7,207,00:13:06,"it was spiky before, though."
7,208,00:13:09,how does that work?
7,209,00:13:14,"hey, give it back!"
7,210,00:13:18,"what is this, a kid's science experiment class?"
7,211,00:13:21,such primitive...
7,212,00:13:30,"chrome, did you think all this up by yourself in this primitive village?"
7,213,00:13:36,you gathered all these potentially useful
7,214,00:13:38,minerals and scientific materials in that shed by yourself?
7,215,00:13:42,"yeah, that's right. that a problem?"
7,216,00:13:45,kids collect everything.
7,217,00:13:48,"they smash things together, mix them, burn them..."
7,218,00:13:51,"and if something crazy happens, that's sorcery."
7,219,00:13:54,what else could it be?
7,220,00:14:02,"check it out, tsukasa."
7,221,00:14:04,"even if you kill me, even if you kill anyone, even if you reset science..."
7,222,00:14:10,"there's always an idiot who'll try anything,"
7,223,00:14:15,and the shiny monkeys will inevitably create a technological civilization.
7,224,00:14:24,"chrome, the way things are going,"
7,225,00:14:27,you're ten billion percent one of the people tsukasa is going to kill.
7,226,00:14:31,your only choice is to join our kingdom of science.
7,227,00:14:35,tsukasa? what are you talking about?
7,228,00:14:39,i'd love to have you and this entire shed of science in our kingdom.
7,229,00:14:44,"you're not getting it, jerk! get down!"
7,230,00:14:46,"damn it, i look stupid."
7,231,00:14:47,i can't back down now.
7,232,00:14:50,"i challenge you to one last fight, then."
7,233,00:14:52,it's a duel!
7,234,00:14:53,"if you lose, you'll grovel and leave the village for good."
7,235,00:14:56,"if you win, i'll give you everything, shed and all."
7,236,00:14:59,challenge?
7,237,00:15:00,i'll show you some insane sorcery.
7,238,00:15:02,i've never lost in my whole life.
7,239,00:15:05,arithmetic!
7,240,00:15:06,fight me in a battle of numbers!
7,241,00:15:08,i'm pretty sure senku is going to go undefeated.
7,242,00:15:17,{\an1}shed of scienceand chromeacquired!!
7,243,00:15:21,this is exhilarating!
7,244,00:15:25,"how many years did it take you to find all this stuff, dude?"
7,245,00:15:29,"see that? it's awesome, isn't it?"
7,246,00:15:31,you may have wrecked me in sorcery and arithme—
7,247,00:15:33,"i mean, i was off my game today anyway..."
7,248,00:15:36,but my collection is the best there is!
7,249,00:15:38,they're all just rocks.
7,250,00:15:43,malachite! chalanthite! corundum!
7,251,00:15:46,that one's seriously tough.
7,252,00:15:48,i have no idea how they're different.
7,253,00:15:50,why are you two getting so excited about rocks?
7,254,00:15:54,"oh, man, galena!"
7,255,00:15:56,lead acquired!
7,256,00:15:57,that one's crazy shiny when you break it.
7,257,00:16:00,nope.
7,258,00:16:01,i just can't understand the way they get so spiritual about collecting rocks.
7,259,00:16:05,i used to collect bugs and stuff.
7,260,00:16:08,now i can't even touch them. they creep me out.
7,261,00:16:10,you even have cinnabar!
7,262,00:16:13,have fun showing off your trophies.
7,263,00:16:16,i have to deliver the hot springs to my sister.
7,264,00:16:20,cinnabar.
7,265,00:16:21,also known as the philosopher's stone.
7,266,00:16:23,"it showed up in dragon quest, too."
7,267,00:16:25,"heat it up, and you get mercury."
7,268,00:16:27,there they go again with their weird sorcery.
7,269,00:16:31,do as you like outside the village.
7,270,00:16:33,"but take so much as one step over this bridge, and i'll kill you."
7,271,00:16:37,rules are rules.
7,272,00:16:40,"melt some gold dust into the mercury, and..."
7,273,00:16:49,don't inhale this smoke.
7,274,00:16:50,it'll kill you.
7,275,00:16:54,and now you have a shiny golden spear.
7,276,00:16:57,"oh, man!"
7,277,00:17:02,what good will this sorcery do?
7,278,00:17:04,it's not good for jack.
7,279,00:17:06,"but you're kinro, aren't you?"
7,280,00:17:08,so a golden sword. it's perfect for you.
7,281,00:17:11,i hope you aren't trying to buy me off with this nonsense.
7,282,00:17:18,nuts.
7,283,00:17:19,that won't work on kinro.
7,284,00:17:21,all he ever says is that rules are rules. he's super stiff.
7,285,00:17:24,that's right.
7,286,00:17:25,rules are rules.
7,287,00:17:29,{\an8}kinro
7,288,00:17:33,"though i don't see the need to remove it, either."
7,289,00:17:38,he just needs one more push!
7,290,00:17:40,a-are there any silver spears?
7,291,00:17:43,you're like one of those people who spend all their time
7,292,00:17:45,collecting materials in monster hunter.
7,293,00:17:48,mon... hun?
7,294,00:17:50,"you have plants, too?"
7,295,00:17:52,"felworts, sweetroot, canker root..."
7,296,00:17:55,they're all used in traditional medicine.
7,297,00:17:57,they're all drugs.
7,298,00:18:03,yeah.
7,299,00:18:04,"i have no idea if they work or not, though."
7,300,00:18:07,i've been trying them on my own body and collecting the ones that were good.
7,301,00:18:12,i'll collect anything if it'll make ruri better.
7,302,00:18:16,that's why i became a sorcerer.
7,303,00:18:28,i thank you for bringing me the healing water of the hot springs
7,304,00:18:32,"for my illness, kohaku."
7,305,00:18:36,you weren't here yesterday. was something the matter?
7,306,00:18:42,i accidentally fell asleep along the way.
7,307,00:18:45,i spent the night in the forest.
7,308,00:18:47,"""accidentally""? please..."
7,309,00:18:49,you need to work on your carelessness.
7,310,00:18:55,"jasper, turquoise, would you mind leaving us for the moment?"
7,311,00:18:59,i'd like to speak with kohaku in private.
7,312,00:19:02,"i can't do that, ruri-sama."
7,313,00:19:04,we can't let the priestess be on her own.
7,314,00:19:06,kohaku is my sister.
7,315,00:19:09,please.
7,316,00:19:21,"kohaku, you idiot!"
7,317,00:19:24,your hair is knotted differently.
7,318,00:19:26,something must have happened to you
7,319,00:19:28,that was grave enough for your hair to come undone.
7,320,00:19:33,ruri-nee!
7,321,00:19:38,please don't do anything crazy.
7,322,00:19:41,i don't have much time left.
7,323,00:19:43,don't put yourself at risk for me.
7,324,00:19:47,"senku, is there no sorcery that can save ruri?"
7,325,00:19:51,no science?
7,326,00:19:53,it depends on her condition.
7,327,00:19:55,but in this stone world...
7,328,00:20:01,"chrome, i should tell you everything."
7,329,00:20:06,"everything that happened 3,700 years ago."
7,330,00:20:10,about the world before the collapse.
7,331,00:21:00,why are you bawling all of a sudden?
7,332,00:21:02,what's up with your emotions?
7,333,00:21:04,i'm not crying!
7,334,00:21:06,"wait, damn it! i am!"
7,335,00:21:08,who caused the petrification?
7,336,00:21:11,"if i ever see them, i'll kill them!"
7,337,00:21:14,how could we lose this?
7,338,00:21:16,our human predecessors
7,339,00:21:17,"spent millions of years slowly building this crazy, technological civilization,"
7,340,00:21:23,and it got wiped out in the blink of an eye?!
7,341,00:21:27,i'm pissed as hell!
7,342,00:21:30,"it's not wiped out, idiot."
7,343,00:21:32,the whole thing's right here.
7,344,00:21:34,where?
7,345,00:21:35,humanity isn't going down that easily.
7,346,00:21:39,two million years of human history is
7,347,00:21:44,right here inside me.
7,348,00:21:48,and right here inside you.
7,349,00:21:50,am i wrong?
7,350,00:21:53,you're not wrong.
7,351,00:21:55,of course you're not.
7,352,00:21:56,"senku, i'm going to build this nation of science with you."
7,353,00:22:00,and i'm going to defeat ruri's sickness!
7,354,00:22:03,so tell me!
7,355,00:22:04,didn't you say earlier
7,356,00:22:06,that there's a scientific way to save ruri?!
7,357,00:22:12,yeah.
7,358,00:22:13,we're making the ultimate medicine of science...
7,359,00:22:17,the antibiotic.
7,360,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
7,361,00:24:00,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
8,1,00:00:06,someone from outside the village?
8,2,00:00:10,it's that criminal who got kicked out of the village a long time ago.
8,3,00:00:14,who else could it be?
8,4,00:00:17,maybe the stone statue people have started moving.
8,5,00:00:20,no way.
8,6,00:00:23,"it surely wasn't kohaku who brought that foreigner in, was it?"
8,7,00:00:28,we don't know yet.
8,8,00:00:30,"no, it was."
8,9,00:00:31,it was kohaku-chan.
8,10,00:00:33,"jasper, you heard what ginro said."
8,11,00:00:36,don't tell such obvious lies for her.
8,12,00:00:39,that fool!
8,13,00:00:42,"i've disowned her, and she still doesn't obey the rules."
8,14,00:00:45,damn it.
8,15,00:00:49,ruri!
8,16,00:00:58,"tell me, senku."
8,17,00:01:00,how do we make the cure-all medicine?
8,18,00:01:02,we're going to defeat ruri's sickness!
8,19,00:01:05,"i'll help in any way i can, if it means ruri-nee will get better!"
8,20,00:01:12,ruri-sama!
8,21,00:01:13,i'm so worried.
8,22,00:01:17,she's not sick anymore!
8,23,00:01:19,hooray for science!
8,24,00:01:20,i'm going to join the kingdom of science!
8,25,00:01:23,i see what he's thinking.
8,26,00:01:25,he's planning to save ruri as part of some sleazy scheme.
8,27,00:01:28,i can't decide if he's a gentleman or a slimeball.
8,28,00:01:32,"i guess he's just logical, but..."
8,29,00:01:36,the kingdom of science is going to be making an antibiotic.
8,30,00:01:40,it's the scientific wonder drug that kills bacteria infecting a person.
8,31,00:01:45,it's saved hundreds of millions of lives
8,32,00:01:47,ever since it was discovered in the early twentieth century.
8,33,00:01:51,we can't do blood tests.
8,34,00:01:53,we have no idea what her disease even is.
8,35,00:01:56,but it's worth trying it anyway.
8,36,00:02:00,"all right, let's get on it right away!"
8,37,00:02:02,what do we need?
8,38,00:02:03,we're missing all kinds of stuff.
8,39,00:02:05,pay attention when i talk.
8,40,00:02:07,there are two routes to making antibiotics.
8,41,00:02:10,"we can take the biological route and make penicillin from living things,"
8,42,00:02:11,{\an8}sulfa drug
8,43,00:02:11,{\an8}penicillin
8,44,00:02:13,or we can take the stone route and make sulfa drugs from rocks.
8,45,00:02:16,"hang on, senku."
8,46,00:02:18,living things? rocks?
8,47,00:02:20,how would you make medicine from those?
8,48,00:02:23,"penicillin, made from green mold,is the more famous one."
8,49,00:02:26,"but making penicillin in this stone world would be a crazy game of chance,"
8,50,00:02:32,"where we'd be going, ""hey, we managed to stumble upon this super green mold"
8,51,00:02:37,"that's ten billion times more powerful, woo!"""
8,52,00:02:39,woo!
8,53,00:02:40,"we'll just have to pray,"
8,54,00:02:43,"""please, lord, give us some of that nice green mold, thanks!"""
8,55,00:02:46,"meanwhile, the stone route, making sulfa drugs,"
8,56,00:02:49,"will take insane amounts of diligence and manpower,"
8,57,00:02:52,"but even in this stone world, we'll land on the drug, ten billion percent."
8,58,00:02:57,then the answer is obvious!
8,59,00:03:00,"you get it, don't you?"
8,60,00:03:04,we're neither gods nor geniuses.
8,61,00:03:07,"we crawl around on the ground, making everything step by step."
8,62,00:03:21,we're taking the stone route.
8,63,00:03:24,we'll get each of these things one by one
8,64,00:03:26,and warp right through two million years of science history.
8,65,00:03:31,this is the science roadmap to the cure-all.
8,66,00:03:34,{\an8}iron
8,67,00:03:34,{\an8}alcohol
8,68,00:03:34,{\an8}electricity
8,69,00:03:34,{\an8}vinegar
8,70,00:03:34,{\an8}sodiumbicarbonate

8,84,00:03:34,{\an8}acetic anhydride
8,85,00:03:34,{\an8}ammonia
8,86,00:03:34,{\an8}cure-allsulfa drugs
8,87,00:05:16,"oh, damn, man!"
8,88,00:05:18,"let's start with this ""iron"" stuff, then."
8,89,00:05:20,"wait, what is iron, anyway?"
8,90,00:05:22,teach me everything.
8,91,00:05:24,iron isn't going to be that easy.
8,92,00:05:26,"senku-sensei's sorcery science classes, huh?"
8,93,00:05:30,i don't think i could even keep up.
8,94,00:05:35,are you serious?! damn!
8,95,00:05:38,the planet's the one that's moving?! dude!
8,96,00:05:42,"yeah, that's right."
8,97,00:05:44,that doesn't make sense.
8,98,00:05:46,"why am i not being flung off this branch, then?"
8,99,00:05:49,because there's gravity.
8,100,00:05:52,i always thought it was weird.
8,101,00:05:54,some of the stars don't move at all.
8,102,00:05:57,that's the north star.
8,103,00:05:59,it's a ridiculously useful star that's ten billion percent true north.
8,104,00:06:03,remember that.
8,105,00:06:04,"oh, is it?"
8,106,00:06:06,it seems slightly off from true north.
8,107,00:06:09,it can't be. it's within the margin of error—
8,108,00:06:14,earth's axis is shifting!
8,109,00:06:16,"the whole planet has tilted slightly over the past 3,700 years."
8,110,00:06:22,"it's currently ad 5,379."
8,111,00:06:25,the north star's moved!
8,112,00:06:28,no wonder my gps screwed up and got me lost on my way to hakone.
8,113,00:06:34,a true scientist would laugh at me.
8,114,00:06:37,how could i not have seen that?
8,115,00:06:40,you guys are way more observant because you have no preconceived notions.
8,116,00:06:44,i'm such a loser.
8,117,00:06:48,"you don't seem like a loser to me, senku."
8,118,00:06:53,i'm not saying that to put myself down.
8,119,00:06:55,"i think of myself as being so rational,"
8,120,00:06:57,but i couldn't keep up on this scale. that's all.
8,121,00:07:01,"3,700 years."
8,122,00:07:04,it never hit me until now how insanely long that is.
8,123,00:07:08,"wait, how did you know that the ex-north star isn't true north?"
8,124,00:07:14,so even the great senku doesn't know about this rock!
8,125,00:07:18,this crazy rock that i happened to find on a bald mountain!
8,126,00:07:22,"for some reason, when you hang it or float it, it always points straight north!"
8,127,00:07:25,isn't that nuts?
8,128,00:07:30,it's a magnet.
8,129,00:07:31,you know of it?! damn it!
8,130,00:07:36,"good going, chrome."
8,131,00:07:38,if we have magnets...
8,132,00:07:53,look at how much it picked up.
8,133,00:07:55,all this suspicious black sand!
8,134,00:07:58,we're finally taking the first step on the road to the kingdom of science.
8,135,00:08:01,{\an8}iron
8,136,00:08:01,the curtain is rising on the age of iron!
8,137,00:08:04,now that's exhilarating.
8,138,00:08:07,"seriously, though, that lioness..."
8,139,00:08:09,is everyone in your village like that?
8,140,00:08:12,"we have a few brute strength gorillas,"
8,141,00:08:15,but kohaku's the only agile gorilla.
8,142,00:08:17,i said i'm not a gorilla!
8,143,00:08:19,"also, i'm doing all the collecting here!"
8,144,00:08:22,"why don't you guys get off your asses and do some work, too?"
8,145,00:08:24,we don't have enough manpower!
8,146,00:08:27,sorry.
8,147,00:08:29,{\an4}acquired iron sand!!
8,148,00:08:31,"she's right, though. this is going to take all day."
8,149,00:08:35,should i get someone from the village to help out?
8,150,00:08:37,"as far as the villagers know, you two are both suspicious sorcerers."
8,151,00:08:42,"sadly, no one's going to come help."
8,152,00:08:52,a watermelon?
8,153,00:08:58,it's suika.
8,154,00:09:00,why are you here?
8,155,00:09:04,did you follow us here?
8,156,00:09:07,her name is suika?
8,157,00:09:09,"it's a nickname, probably."
8,158,00:09:11,she's always wearing a watermelon rind.
8,159,00:09:15,"hey, suika! you took my magnet!"
8,160,00:09:20,iron sand.
8,161,00:09:22,i want to help.
8,162,00:09:25,i can never make myself useful to anyone because i have this thing on my head.
8,163,00:09:30,that's not going to change even when i grow up.
8,164,00:09:35,so if there's ever anyone in need...
8,165,00:09:38,"yeah, yeah, i get it."
8,166,00:09:43,i appreciate it.
8,167,00:09:45,the kingdom of science doesn't turn anyone away.
8,168,00:09:48,we need all the help we can get.
8,169,00:09:52,a shrimp like you would be ten billion times better at gathering sand.
8,170,00:09:58,"we're counting on you, suika."
8,171,00:10:05,he's the first person to not ask me why i'm wearing this on my head.
8,172,00:10:11,"he must have thought i don't want anyone to see my face, so he's being nice."
8,173,00:10:15,you really don't know senku. you're glorifying him too much.
8,174,00:10:20,"he just doesn't care what you look like, as long as you're useful."
8,175,00:10:24,i'm going to gather all the iron sand!
8,176,00:10:27,"donburako, donburako..."
8,177,00:10:30,"who are you, momotaro?!"
8,178,00:10:31,don't drown!
8,179,00:10:35,"you don't know dragon quest or monster hunter, but you do know momotaro?"
8,180,00:10:39,who taught you?
8,181,00:10:40,"hey, you know momotaro, too?"
8,182,00:10:44,ruri-nee told us all about him.
8,183,00:10:47,"come to think of it, why do you know about gorillas?"
8,184,00:10:50,are they out in the wild?
8,185,00:10:52,i've never actually seen one.
8,186,00:10:55,"but there's a gorilla in momotaro, isn't there?"
8,187,00:10:57,"no, there isn't!"
8,188,00:11:00,"he used millet dumplings to win friends, remember?"
8,189,00:11:02,"a bear, a lion, a gorilla, and an alligator."
8,190,00:11:06,what kind of wild-ass momotaro is that?!
8,191,00:11:09,was it meant to be an easy-to-understand story to teach about dangerous animals?
8,192,00:11:14,"i heard all kinds of stories from ruri-nee, too."
8,193,00:11:18,"come to think of it, i think i learned all my big words from ruri-nee, too."
8,194,00:11:23,ruri...
8,195,00:11:24,just who are you?
8,196,00:11:27,i'm low-key interested in this ruri chick.
8,197,00:11:32,"we really need to make the cure-alland save her, whatever it takes."
8,198,00:11:38,"what do you mean, you're interested in ruri?"
8,199,00:11:40,"what does that mean, senku?"
8,200,00:11:43,"senku, senku, senku-sensei..."
8,201,00:11:46,chrome seems to have a crush on ruri-nee.
8,202,00:11:50,so that's what it was.
8,203,00:11:52,here we go.
8,204,00:11:54,and chrome's such a child.
8,205,00:11:57,i like how oblivious he is.
8,206,00:12:00,what are you guys talking about?!
8,207,00:12:01,"damn it, who are you calling a child?!"
8,208,00:12:05,"so the black sand we got from the river turns into this ""iron"" stuff?"
8,209,00:12:09,yeah.
8,210,00:12:10,"mix four parts iron sand to one part coal, and bake."
8,211,00:12:13,"hey, that's easy."
8,212,00:12:17,it's harder than it sounds.
8,213,00:12:19,it's not like making clay pots.
8,214,00:12:21,the highest temperature we can getby burning wood is 700 degrees.
8,215,00:12:26,"but ironmaking, turning iron sand into iron, requires 1,500 degrees."
8,216,00:12:32,that's not even close to enough.
8,217,00:12:34,what do we do?
8,218,00:12:36,we blow like hell.
8,219,00:12:38,we have to give it as much oxygen as we can.
8,220,00:12:41,we'll send in a ton of air
8,221,00:12:43,"and double the flame's damage output from 700 to 1,500."
8,222,00:12:48,this thing blows air?
8,223,00:12:50,"with something this useful, i could probably do it by myself."
8,224,00:12:53,you can make that claim once you've done it.
8,225,00:12:55,we're never going to have enough manpower.
8,226,00:13:08,"damn it, my arms are killing me!"
8,227,00:13:11,don't you dare take a break! it'll get cooler!
8,228,00:13:14,how many more minutes are we doing this?
8,229,00:13:16,roughly... another... twenty to thirty hours.
8,230,00:13:19,ironmaking is insane!
8,231,00:13:24,"don't push yourself, suika!"
8,232,00:13:26,take a break!
8,233,00:13:28,i still can't make myself useful.
8,234,00:13:33,it looks like they're up to something really grueling.
8,235,00:13:37,i-i... i think i'm going to help—
8,236,00:13:40,"no, ginro."
8,237,00:13:42,don't abandon your post.
8,238,00:13:43,rules are rules.
8,239,00:13:44,come on.
8,240,00:13:46,just because you already had a golden spear made for you...
8,241,00:13:49,i want...
8,242,00:13:50,a thing?!
8,243,00:13:51,"that's incredibly low, ginro!"
8,244,00:13:55,"swap spears with me, then."
8,245,00:13:57,no.
8,246,00:13:57,"i'll settle for gold, even though that's kin for gold instead of gin for silver."
8,247,00:14:02,no!
8,248,00:14:16,manpower is our top priority.
8,249,00:14:19,the kingdom of science needs more citizens.
8,250,00:14:23,the spear...
8,251,00:14:24,kinro...
8,252,00:14:27,i knew it.
8,253,00:14:28,we almost have ginro.
8,254,00:14:30,good.
8,255,00:14:31,this is working in our favor!
8,256,00:14:33,we're using the bait that is science to gain manpower!
8,257,00:14:37,"quit calling it bait, both of you."
8,258,00:14:40,but it's not like the whole village is going to appreciate a shiny spear.
8,259,00:14:44,we need intel about what people want.
8,260,00:14:48,i'm good at that kind of thing!
8,261,00:14:51,"i can turn into a watermelon, so i can go anywhere without being noticed!"
8,262,00:14:59,not bad.
8,263,00:15:00,"all right, great detective suika-sama,"
8,264,00:15:03,we call on your services to find us manpower for ironmaking.
8,265,00:15:06,"you got this, great detective suika!"
8,266,00:15:10,great detective suika...
8,267,00:15:12,i'm going to make myself useful!
8,268,00:15:23,so where did that foreigner go?
8,269,00:15:26,the one kohaku supposedly brought in.
8,270,00:15:30,he's living in chrome's shed!
8,271,00:15:35,"the elder believes we should let him be,"
8,272,00:15:38,so long as he doesn't try to come into the village.
8,273,00:15:42,i agree with that.
8,274,00:15:44,but if he tries to do anything funny...
8,275,00:15:48,i'll kill anyone who's a threat.
8,276,00:15:50,yeah!
8,277,00:15:52,and ruri will fall for me.
8,278,00:15:54,yeah!
8,279,00:15:56,"the only question is whether that man is strong or not, right?"
8,280,00:16:01,i don't care if he's strong or not.
8,281,00:16:03,what matters is that he's got a good face.
8,282,00:16:06,i don't care about a man's inner or outer beauty!
8,283,00:16:09,as long as he can hunt and stuff!
8,284,00:16:10,"seriously, though..."
8,285,00:16:12,"all three of us sisters have different tastes, so how are we all still single?!"
8,286,00:16:19,fresh fish is so delicious.
8,287,00:16:22,the flesh is so firm.
8,288,00:16:24,i'm so tired of grilled fish.
8,289,00:16:34,"i went to listen in on people, to see if there's anything they want."
8,290,00:16:38,"first, the dazzling sisters, garnet, sapphire, and ruby."
8,291,00:16:43,"ah, the prettiest girls in town."
8,292,00:16:46,what those three really want...
8,293,00:16:49,i'd appreciate if it's something we can make with the technology of this age.
8,294,00:16:53,...is a boyfriend!
8,295,00:16:54,and that's something we have no chance of making with science!
8,296,00:16:58,a strong man.
8,297,00:16:59,a handsome man.
8,298,00:17:00,someone who'll feed me.
8,299,00:17:02,they're perfectly faithful to their desires.
8,300,00:17:06,"if you ask me, you're quite an attractive man, senku."
8,301,00:17:11,"but i don't think you're the kind of ""handsome man"" that sapphire's asking for."
8,302,00:17:14,"look at them, saying whatever they want."
8,303,00:17:18,this is the problem with women.
8,304,00:17:19,that's why i hate women.
8,305,00:17:22,"you're such a child, chrome."
8,306,00:17:24,"ruri-nee and i are both women, so do you hate us?"
8,307,00:17:27,"kohaku, i don't think of you as a woman."
8,308,00:17:30,you're a gorilla.
8,309,00:17:33,i'm sorry.
8,310,00:17:36,i think i have a shot with the one who wants someone to feed her.
8,311,00:17:40,what does she want?
8,312,00:17:41,"a feast, like fish and stuff."
8,313,00:17:44,"speaking of feasts, ganen, the biggest glutton in town,"
8,314,00:17:45,{\an8}so sick of this...
8,315,00:17:48,said he's bored to death of eating grilled fish every day.
8,316,00:17:49,{\an8}so sick of this...
8,317,00:17:52,he's been looking for something new to try.
8,318,00:17:52,{\an8}so sick of this...
8,319,00:17:57,"i knew you could do it, great detective suika-sama."
8,320,00:18:00,i can already see the scientific bait we need to get them on our side.
8,321,00:18:06,are you actually going to cook for them?
8,322,00:18:08,what does that have to do with science?
8,323,00:18:11,it has everything to do with science.
8,324,00:18:12,food is science.
8,325,00:18:15,where do you think the umami of the fish you eat every day comes from?
8,326,00:18:20,it's glutamic acid and inosinic acid.
8,327,00:18:31,"suika, what is that, anyway?"
8,328,00:18:34,this is my friend chalk's favorite toy.
8,329,00:18:38,dogtail millet!
8,330,00:18:39,you mean foxtail millet.
8,331,00:18:41,that might work.
8,332,00:18:45,we might be able to make the world's most delicious dish
8,333,00:18:49,that everyone in my old world loves.
8,334,00:19:03,we're making gourmet survival food from scratch.
8,335,00:19:07,now that's exhilarating.
8,336,00:19:10,"we aren't actually eating this foxtail millet, are we?"
8,337,00:19:16,i think i'll pass.
8,338,00:19:17,we're whacking the hell out of it to husk it so we can eat it.
8,339,00:19:22,"foxtail millet is genuinely, ten billion percent a grain."
8,340,00:19:26,it's a primitive millet.
8,341,00:19:29,it looks mighty nasty.
8,342,00:19:31,it's covered in furry stuff.
8,343,00:19:43,it's a cycle of inspiration and trial-and-error.
8,344,00:19:47,food is a perfect example of science.
8,345,00:19:51,"now we have wheat flour, or rather, foxtail millet flour!"
8,346,00:19:58,"toss in wild bird eggs, and tenderize it using potassium carbonate."
8,347,00:20:05,"it's a dish of science, discovered accidentally"
8,348,00:20:07,by some nameless mongol sometime around the fourth century.
8,349,00:20:11,"i guess there was some crazy nut like you, chrome, who would try anything."
8,350,00:20:16,even in fourth-century mongolia.
8,351,00:20:26,th-this scent...
8,352,00:20:29,"we had a name for this stupidly good scientific food 3,700 years ago."
8,353,00:20:36,"we called it ""ramen."""
8,354,00:20:41,"but this is actually foxtail millet, isn't it?"
8,355,00:20:47,i'll make sure it's safe!
8,356,00:20:49,it's the duty of a sorcerer not to be afraid of anything new!
8,357,00:20:56,i-it's good!
8,358,00:21:00,dude!
8,359,00:21:08,it's so chewy and slippery!
8,360,00:21:10,i've never had anything like it!
8,361,00:21:12,i can't believe such a thing would exist in this world!
8,362,00:21:17,"i guess i'll dig in, too."
8,363,00:21:19,"it's been 3,700 years since i've had a proper meal."
8,364,00:21:27,it wasn't proper at all.
8,365,00:21:29,what did i expect from foxtail millet?
8,366,00:21:32,"it's so damn crumbly, and it has a horrible, bitter aftertaste."
8,367,00:21:36,i guess it's edible if you think of it as medicine.
8,368,00:21:39,"then again, for them, i'm sure it's the food of the gods."
8,369,00:21:44,this'll work.
8,370,00:21:45,foxtail millet ramen!
8,371,00:21:54,what is going on?!
8,372,00:21:59,something smells really good!
8,373,00:22:03,people have waged wars over pepper.
8,374,00:22:06,ramen
8,375,00:22:06,that's how fundamental food is to civilization.
8,376,00:22:12,i'm going to colonize this village with the scientific food that is ramen.
8,377,00:22:17,you look like the villain.
8,378,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
8,379,00:23:58,{\an8}let there be the light of science
8,380,00:24:01,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
9,1,00:00:24,with the gourmet dish of science...
9,2,00:00:29,i can find enough manpower to make steel.
9,3,00:00:33,one foxtail millet ramen!
9,4,00:00:39,it's so chewy! this is amazing!
9,5,00:00:42,"if ganen the glutton says so, well..."
9,6,00:00:46,"oh, man! oh, man!"
9,7,00:00:48,it's so slippery and delicious!
9,8,00:00:50,are you the one who made this tasty stuff?
9,9,00:00:53,your name's senku-kun?
9,10,00:00:54,what kind of girls do you like?
9,11,00:00:56,a girl who can pump a ton of oxygen into the furnace.
9,12,00:00:59,he's way too blunt.
9,13,00:01:01,"you never make small talk or anything, do you, senku?"
9,14,00:01:06,"hey, kinro, ginro!"
9,15,00:01:08,just try this!
9,16,00:01:10,this ramen stuff is insane!
9,17,00:01:13,we will not consume that questionable sorcery food!
9,18,00:01:16,and for the guards to accept gifts of food is out of the question.
9,19,00:01:20,rules are rules.
9,20,00:01:22,yeah? then what's that?
9,21,00:01:25,"you won't take food, but you'll take a golden spear?"
9,22,00:01:28,"yeah, yeah!"
9,23,00:01:36,"chief, your daughter is... kohaku is feeding the villagers."
9,24,00:01:42,what?
9,25,00:01:44,shall we go?
9,26,00:01:45,what for?
9,27,00:01:47,to eat.
9,28,00:01:49,why would i go?
9,29,00:01:54,kohaku...
9,30,00:01:56,what are you doing with the outsider?
9,31,00:01:59,here you go!
9,32,00:02:01,i'm losing track of who i've served!
9,33,00:02:04,the response is amazing.
9,34,00:02:06,everyone's coming over.
9,35,00:02:09,no problem.
9,36,00:02:10,i'll just work them to death in proportion to however much they ate.
9,37,00:02:15,you really do make sketchy faces.
9,38,00:02:19,this is making me thirsty for a drink.
9,39,00:02:22,"like, say, cola."
9,40,00:02:25,cola?
9,41,00:02:29,"senku, is he with you?"
9,42,00:02:31,no.
9,43,00:02:32,ramen!
9,44,00:02:33,{\an8}ramen! ramen! ramen!
9,45,00:02:34,"come on, the noodles are going to get soggy."
9,46,00:02:36,"kinro, ginro, stop squabbling for a moment."
9,47,00:02:39,what?
9,48,00:02:40,what are—
9,49,00:02:42,i'll get to the point.
9,50,00:02:45,enemies.
9,51,00:02:49,"answer truthfully, or i'll slit your throat here and now."
9,52,00:02:53,are you one of the long-haired man's underlings?
9,53,00:03:01,"hey, i wouldn't mind being taken out by a cute girl like you,"
9,54,00:03:05,but i think you have me confused for someone else.
9,55,00:03:11,i don't know anything about a long-haired man.
9,56,00:03:14,i've been by myself ever since i was un-petrified.
9,57,00:04:51,{\an8}let there be the light of science
9,58,00:04:58,i thought i'd seen your face somewhere.
9,59,00:05:01,you're asagiri gen.
9,60,00:05:03,are you acquainted?
9,61,00:05:04,"no, not one bit."
9,62,00:05:07,he's a magician who used to write trashy psychology books.
9,63,00:05:09,magic psychologyasagiri gen
9,64,00:05:10,you've read my work?
9,65,00:05:12,i'm so happy.
9,66,00:05:14,"calling it ""trashy"" hurts, though."
9,67,00:05:16,call me a mentalist.
9,68,00:05:18,"look, i'll apologize for taking the ramen,"
9,69,00:05:22,so would you please lower your weapons?
9,70,00:05:25,"i'm so scared, my arms and legs are trembling."
9,71,00:05:28,i might spill this delicious ramen.
9,72,00:05:31,i-i'll hold on to it for you!
9,73,00:05:34,he's full of crap.
9,74,00:05:36,"i was out looking for food by myself when, surprise,"
9,75,00:05:39,"the nostalgic scent of ramen hit me, and i wandered over."
9,76,00:05:43,this man isn't the least bit terrified.
9,77,00:05:46,and the words he weaves with his mouth carry as little weight as a feather.
9,78,00:05:46,"{\an8}man, it's such a terrible lifestyle out there."
9,79,00:05:52,"sure, whatever. i'll take your word for it."
9,80,00:05:55,"either way, there's no such thing as a free lunch."
9,81,00:05:58,everyone who's had ramen has work to do.
9,82,00:06:08,we upgraded the blowing function!
9,83,00:06:10,"iron mill furnace, level 2!"
9,84,00:06:13,i think this'll work if we take turns!
9,85,00:06:19,asagiri gen.
9,86,00:06:22,how are taiju and yuzuriha doing?
9,87,00:06:27,"oh, i see."
9,88,00:06:29,you thought you could get me to fess up while i'm busting my ass.
9,89,00:06:33,"you have guts, pulling tricks like that on a mentalist."
9,90,00:06:39,"don't worry, though."
9,91,00:06:41,taiju-chan's got an especially bottomless supply of strength.
9,92,00:06:45,"you know, don't you, senku-chan?"
9,93,00:06:48,he's definitely with the long-haired man.
9,94,00:06:51,should i kill him?
9,95,00:06:51,"hold it, idiot."
9,96,00:06:53,asagiri gen.
9,97,00:06:55,you ten billion percent knew i was trying to make you talk.
9,98,00:06:58,why did you suddenly decide to admit that you're with tsukasa?
9,99,00:07:04,the tides have turned now that i've seen this.
9,100,00:07:41,my job is to confirm that you're dead.
9,101,00:07:46,"""tsukasa, senku is alive."""
9,102,00:07:49,"with that, you would be done."
9,103,00:07:52,that was the plan.
9,104,00:07:55,"but if you complete your iron weapons, there's no telling who will win."
9,105,00:08:04,finally!
9,106,00:08:06,{\an4}acquired iron!!
9,107,00:08:09,here we go!
9,108,00:08:09,"""i only found a primitive settlement."
9,109,00:08:13,"senku is dead."""
9,110,00:08:15,that simple false report would spare you.
9,111,00:08:21,i'd really appreciate it if you would do that.
9,112,00:08:25,i don't have any policy at all.
9,113,00:08:27,i'm the world's most shallow man.
9,114,00:08:29,"if i can live happily with cute chicks, that's all i need."
9,115,00:08:33,whether you die or tsukasa dies doesn't matter to me.
9,116,00:08:39,"i'm going to win, no matter who i have to dispose of."
9,117,00:08:43,i can't decide if it'll be better for me if i let the kingdom of science
9,118,00:08:47,or the tsukasa empire win.
9,119,00:08:50,that's all i have any interest in.
9,120,00:08:53,"on this side, there's plenty of sweet science stuff and ramen and all that,"
9,121,00:08:57,but the work is hellish.
9,122,00:09:01,"meanwhile, tsukasa-chan's empire has no science and the meals are simple,"
9,123,00:09:05,but the work's easy.
9,124,00:09:07,"and if i revive idols and stuff, i'll be living the dream harem life."
9,125,00:09:11,what's a harem?
9,126,00:09:13,"sorry, children don't need to know yet."
9,127,00:09:17,i think ramen's better for sure.
9,128,00:09:21,"ramen's nice, but not on hot days like this."
9,129,00:09:24,"at the end of the day, i'd side with tsukasa-chan."
9,130,00:09:27,"asagiri gen, was it?"
9,131,00:09:30,"superficial, selfish men like you are best dead or imprisoned."
9,132,00:09:35,so scary!
9,133,00:09:36,"no, if we don't let him go back,"
9,134,00:09:38,"tsukasa will come here himself, and we'll be screwed."
9,135,00:09:46,relax.
9,136,00:09:48,"once you see what we make with our beautiful new iron,"
9,137,00:09:53,you'll ten billion percent want to join the kingdom of science.
9,138,00:09:57,oh? what's that?
9,139,00:09:59,are you making swords or something?
9,140,00:10:03,a generator.
9,141,00:10:08,a generator?!
9,142,00:10:09,are you for real?!
9,143,00:10:11,that's totally not happening!
9,144,00:10:12,"hey, you have native copper."
9,145,00:10:15,it's pretty. i don't want to break it.
9,146,00:10:18,we'll melt it down to make copper wire.
9,147,00:10:19,he's not even listening. damn.
9,148,00:10:21,"now, if only we'd get some lightning..."
9,149,00:10:33,anger of the heavens!
9,150,00:10:34,it's lightning!
9,151,00:10:35,"if it hits you, you're dead!"
9,152,00:10:38,"women and children, get inside!"
9,153,00:10:40,"hurry, quick!"
9,154,00:10:42,we actually got lightning.
9,155,00:10:43,"well, it is thunderstorm season."
9,156,00:10:46,we're way too lucky!
9,157,00:10:48,"no, idiot! this is the worst case scenario!"
9,158,00:10:51,we aren't prepared at all!
9,159,00:10:53,"you aren't making a lightning generator, are you?"
9,160,00:10:56,there's no such thing.
9,161,00:10:57,of course.
9,162,00:10:58,magnets.
9,163,00:11:00,i can make a generator if i have magnets.
9,164,00:11:02,we have some of the iron sand that we got.
9,165,00:11:05,the natural stuff isn't anywhere near strong enough.
9,166,00:11:08,we're going to catch the lightning with an iron rod
9,167,00:11:10,and make a high-power magnet with the power of science.
9,168,00:11:13,"i was going to put up a stupid number of lightning rods,"
9,169,00:11:17,but we can't pass up this opportunity.
9,170,00:11:19,we're going to get set up immediately.
9,171,00:11:24,"we're moving lightning fast, literally!"
9,172,00:11:28,melt the copper.
9,173,00:11:30,kohaku's shield is coated with lacquer.
9,174,00:11:32,it's somewhere in the village!
9,175,00:11:35,i brought the lacquer!
9,176,00:11:37,lacquer is a crazy good insulator.
9,177,00:11:40,coat the iron rod with it.
9,178,00:11:43,what are you doing?
9,179,00:11:46,wh-what are you doing with the bridge planks?
9,180,00:11:50,i carved a channel in the plank.
9,181,00:11:53,pour the copper into the channel.
9,182,00:11:55,wrap the solidified copper all around the iron.
9,183,00:12:01,"oh no, oh no! the foreigners are destroying the bridge!"
9,184,00:12:09,"so he's finally showing his true, evil colors."
9,185,00:12:12,"i bet they called down the anger of the heavens with their sorcery, too."
9,186,00:12:17,yeah!
9,187,00:12:18,let me take care of it.
9,188,00:12:19,i'll kill them.
9,189,00:12:26,"shoot, it's magma!"
9,190,00:12:28,he's not one to listen to reason.
9,191,00:12:30,we're going to have to fight them!
9,192,00:12:32,we're screwed if we go to war against the village right now.
9,193,00:12:35,"damn it, what can we do?"
9,194,00:12:38,i guess i don't have a choice.
9,195,00:12:40,i'd rather not get killed in the fray.
9,196,00:12:45,"can i have a bouquet of flowers, suika-chan?"
9,197,00:12:50,flowers over war.
9,198,00:13:00,why the hell is this sly guy holding flowers?
9,199,00:13:05,yeah!
9,200,00:13:06,were you the one who summoned the anger of the heavens?
9,201,00:13:10,"you have balls, coming to me to get yourself killed."
9,202,00:13:14,"oh, no, no. it's the other way around."
9,203,00:13:17,we're here to stop the lightning with our sorcery.
9,204,00:13:21,quit talking out of your ass.
9,205,00:13:24,like this.
9,206,00:13:28,it actually disappeared right before our eyes!
9,207,00:13:31,that's enough to keep it out of magma's sight?
9,208,00:13:34,it's a trick called the back palm or something.
9,209,00:13:37,magicians do it with cards and stuff.
9,210,00:13:41,"not bad, you fraud magician."
9,211,00:14:00,it's not impossible at all.
9,212,00:14:02,an old guy named wasilewski at nasa has already succeeded in an experiment
9,213,00:14:07,to make magnets using lightning.
9,214,00:14:11,wasilewski!
9,215,00:14:17,i happened to find this crazy rock on a bald mountain!
9,216,00:14:22,"chrome, this is the fruit of your ten years of exploration."
9,217,00:14:27,that's right. are you amazed or what?
9,218,00:14:30,"we're here, at the bald mountain."
9,219,00:14:32,it's the perfect spot for lightning.
9,220,00:14:34,there's no better place.
9,221,00:14:44,"set up the lightning rod, quick!"
9,222,00:14:49,they're making a tower or something.
9,223,00:14:51,i want to help—
9,224,00:14:52,ginro!
9,225,00:14:53,"you just want a silver spear, don't you?"
9,226,00:14:55,our job is to keep an eye on them.
9,227,00:14:57,rules are rules.
9,228,00:15:00,the lightning's closing in.
9,229,00:15:02,"crap, we don't have time to build a proper tower."
9,230,00:15:05,"but, damn it, we need to make it as tall as we can."
9,231,00:15:08,if only there were something long we could shove into the ground...
9,232,00:15:15,n-no!
9,233,00:15:17,anything but my spear!
9,234,00:15:18,so you do like it.
9,235,00:15:34,my spear!
9,236,00:15:44,and so the god of lightning descends.
9,237,00:15:55,"what's up with you, senku-chan?"
9,238,00:15:57,there's nothing to work with in this stone-age world.
9,239,00:16:00,are you seriously going to...
9,240,00:16:13,"electricity, born with a bang."
9,241,00:16:18,this is exhilarating.
9,242,00:16:20,yeah!
9,243,00:16:22,we got a magnet for the generator!
9,244,00:16:30,"jeez, the golden spear's in pieces."
9,245,00:16:33,"sorry, but you'll have to forgive me, kinro."
9,246,00:16:35,it was an emergency.
9,247,00:16:37,i'm sure senku will make you another one.
9,248,00:16:40,"hey, where'd your spear go?"
9,249,00:16:43,"it's gone, eh?"
9,250,00:16:44,the golden spear that you had made for you and never let me borrow.
9,251,00:16:48,huh?
9,252,00:16:53,"senku, we may have failed to make magnets."
9,253,00:16:57,"they won't go near each other, let alone stick!"
9,254,00:16:59,they're being repelled by some mysterious force.
9,255,00:17:03,you have the poles backwards.
9,256,00:17:07,{\an4}acquired powerful magnets!!
9,257,00:17:10,{\an8}they're so strong!
9,258,00:17:13,"now we can make that crazy ""electricity"" thing, right?"
9,259,00:17:17,{\an8}iron
9,260,00:17:18,{\an8}powerful magnets
9,261,00:17:19,{\an8}copper
9,262,00:17:19,{\an8}phosphorus
9,263,00:17:20,{\an8}electricity
9,264,00:17:22,"but senku-chan, are you making a thermal generator?"
9,265,00:17:26,wind turbines?
9,266,00:17:28,don't tell me you're making a nuclear reactor.
9,267,00:17:32,muscle-powered generator.
9,268,00:17:34,of course. i should have known.
9,269,00:17:43,whack the hell out of the copper sheet and file it down into a disk.
9,270,00:17:53,check it out!
9,271,00:17:54,"i'm going to file it down with corundum, that tough rock i showed you before!"
9,272,00:17:59,the second-strongest mineral after diamond.
9,273,00:18:01,"i like your collection, chrome."
9,274,00:18:08,"i thought of coating the copper wire with phosphoric acid,"
9,275,00:18:11,"but lathering it in lacquer works, too."
9,276,00:18:14,"so, senku-chan..."
9,277,00:18:16,i've been wondering when i should bring this up...
9,278,00:18:20,what?
9,279,00:18:21,why have you turned into anpanman?
9,280,00:18:24,lacquer rash.
9,281,00:18:30,all right!
9,282,00:18:32,it's the kingdom of science's special...
9,283,00:18:38,dual-wield hand-crank generator.
9,284,00:18:41,{\an4}acquired power generator!!
9,285,00:18:43,we have to spin the two disks at the same time?
9,286,00:18:46,that'll be pretty hard.
9,287,00:18:48,we just need two people to do it together.
9,288,00:18:50,"we'll have to spin it in perfect timing, or it'll crumble to bits."
9,289,00:18:54,if only there were two people
9,290,00:18:56,who worked in perfect syncand had a lot of energy...
9,291,00:19:03,you lot again.
9,292,00:19:05,what do you want this time?
9,293,00:19:07,i'll show you our badass science machine! come with us!
9,294,00:19:09,why would i go?
9,295,00:19:12,you're as stubborn as ever.
9,296,00:19:15,what are you not satisfied with?
9,297,00:19:18,he's obviously upset about his golden spear getting wrecked.
9,298,00:19:25,"man, electricity is so amazing."
9,299,00:19:28,"in technological civilization,"
9,300,00:19:30,"our world of sorcery, all sorts of contraptions work on electricity."
9,301,00:19:36,"with electricity, we might even be able to make and repair gold and silver spears."
9,302,00:19:42,"right, senku-chan?"
9,303,00:19:44,electrocoating isn't that easy.
9,304,00:19:47,do you even know the recipe?
9,305,00:19:49,i don't know a single thing.
9,306,00:19:51,asagiri gen...
9,307,00:19:53,your words really are as flimsy as a feather.
9,308,00:20:04,you can count on the brothers to be perfectly in sync with each other.
9,309,00:20:07,"now that we have kinro and ginro,"
9,310,00:20:09,the kingdom of science is really starting to shape up.
9,311,00:20:12,are they really making electricity?
9,312,00:20:20,this is a steam-roasted bamboo string.
9,313,00:20:27,do you need it to be a high spot?
9,314,00:20:29,it doesn't matter.
9,315,00:20:31,"but, hey, we might as well."
9,316,00:20:39,i see. it's an edison light bulb made using japanese bamboo.
9,317,00:20:45,edison light bulb?
9,318,00:20:48,"chrome, are you afraid of the night?"
9,319,00:20:51,"yeah, it is dark, after all."
9,320,00:20:55,why do you ask?
9,321,00:20:59,there's no darkness in my age.
9,322,00:21:05,old edison erased night from the world with his incandescent light bulb.
9,323,00:21:10,he conquered the twenty-four-hour day.
9,324,00:21:15,"with science, humanity defeated the night."
9,325,00:21:22,this is going to light the darkness
9,326,00:21:24,"of the night for the first time in 3,700 years."
9,327,00:21:28,it's the flame of science.
9,328,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
9,329,00:23:58,{\an8}a tenuous alliance
9,330,00:24:01,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
10,1,00:00:09,the first biography i ever read
10,2,00:00:11,{\an1}biography seriesedison
10,3,00:00:11,once i started going through science books was edison's.
10,4,00:00:16,"what even is electricity, anyway?"
10,5,00:00:19,"huh, there are only four fundamental forces in the universe?"
10,6,00:00:19,science explained
10,7,00:00:19,stories about space that will keep you up at night
10,8,00:00:19,intro to cosmology
10,9,00:00:19,encyclopedia of incredible science i
10,10,00:00:19,science basics in manga
10,11,00:00:19,encyclopedia of incredible science ii
10,12,00:00:24,"gravity, electromagnetism..."
10,13,00:00:25,{\an8}what's five plus three?
10,14,00:00:26,so that's what electricity is.
10,15,00:00:28,and then there's the strong force and the weak force?
10,16,00:00:33,that's hilariously weird.
10,17,00:00:37,"basically, electricity is the most essential power in this universe."
10,18,00:00:43,how exhilarating is that?
10,19,00:01:08,i was born buck-naked and alone on this primitive earth.
10,20,00:01:13,"a year and four months later, i've finally made it."
10,21,00:01:19,to the essential power of science...
10,22,00:01:22,to electricity.
10,23,00:01:28,this is it.
10,24,00:01:30,i'm off to a good start.
10,25,00:01:44,all right!
10,26,00:01:47,"man, electricity in the stone age!"
10,27,00:01:50,seriously!
10,28,00:01:55,"right, tsukasa-chan?"
10,29,00:03:29,{\an8}a flimsy alliance
10,30,00:03:34,"so you see, suika, this man called tsukasa"
10,31,00:03:38,is the one behind senku's murder.
10,32,00:03:41,though i'm not dead.
10,33,00:03:42,he's seriously bad news.
10,34,00:03:45,"he wanted to stop scientific progress,"
10,35,00:03:47,and he didn't think twice about killing senku to do it.
10,36,00:03:50,"i told you, i'm not dead."
10,37,00:03:53,"so that tsukasa person is a bad man, and gen is with him?"
10,38,00:03:58,then gen's a bad person!
10,39,00:04:01,wait... but gen saved us from magma.
10,40,00:04:05,he's a good person!
10,41,00:04:07,he's neither a good person nor a bad person.
10,42,00:04:10,he's just a thoroughly shallow bat of a man.
10,43,00:04:12,it doesn't matter whether asagiri gen is a good guy or a bad guy.
10,44,00:04:16,we need him to be on the side of the kingdom of science.
10,45,00:04:19,"we'll have him make a bogus report to tsukasa, saying ""senku is definitely dead."""
10,46,00:04:25,that's the only way we can win.
10,47,00:04:30,"hear that, gen?"
10,48,00:04:32,"you saw it, didn't you?"
10,49,00:04:33,the electricity?
10,50,00:04:34,the insane light of science?
10,51,00:04:37,who cares about who wins?
10,52,00:04:39,who gives a damn about whether tsukasa or senku has the edge?
10,53,00:04:43,the kingdom of science is just way more fun!
10,54,00:04:49,"gosh, you're so passionate, young man."
10,55,00:04:53,"too bad, though."
10,56,00:04:54,"i don't have what you do, chrome-chan."
10,57,00:04:57,i'm the most superficial man on earth.
10,58,00:05:00,all i care about is whether or not something will benefit me.
10,59,00:05:25,"what is this, a prank?"
10,60,00:05:28,did my manager not stop them?
10,61,00:05:30,"i told them i'm a mentalist, so i only work as the prankster."
10,62,00:05:36,it's ad 5739.
10,63,00:05:40,but you're still nineteen years old.
10,64,00:05:44,huh?
10,65,00:05:46,aren't you...
10,66,00:05:46,mentalist battle!!
10,67,00:05:47,from the tv special about psychological magic?
10,68,00:05:49,"you were on screen with me, weren't you?"
10,69,00:05:54,"oh, right."
10,70,00:05:55,"you're the ""strongest primate high-schooler,"""
10,71,00:05:58,shishio tsukasa-chan!
10,72,00:06:02,i'm gathering here the statues
10,73,00:06:06,"of the people who ought to be revived first, including you."
10,74,00:06:22,the dusty old people of power aren't needed in this beautiful stone world.
10,75,00:06:29,"let's make a new world together,"
10,76,00:06:32,gen.
10,77,00:06:35,"there's something i'd like you to do, as a skilled mentalist."
10,78,00:06:43,follow them.
10,79,00:06:45,figure out their psychology.
10,80,00:06:47,"i'm just being extra careful,"
10,81,00:06:49,"but if this man, senku, is still alive, i want you to find him."
10,82,00:06:54,senku?
10,83,00:06:55,senku was the first one to revive.
10,84,00:06:58,this is where he created a drug to undo the petrification using the power of science.
10,85,00:07:03,he's the man who revived me.
10,86,00:07:06,"and he was attempting to revive all humans,"
10,87,00:07:10,"including the tainted old people,"
10,88,00:07:13,and start a civilization that would create weapons of science.
10,89,00:07:18,"the most intelligent man in the world,"
10,90,00:07:20,whom i killed with these hands.
10,91,00:07:48,who... are you?
10,92,00:07:52,why...
10,93,00:08:02,what was that noise?
10,94,00:08:08,"hey, are you all right, gen?"
10,95,00:08:09,it's no use...
10,96,00:08:10,he obviously died instantly.
10,97,00:08:12,this is terrible!
10,98,00:08:14,"no, hang on."
10,99,00:08:19,he guarded himself with bags of fake blood.
10,100,00:08:21,they're all over him!
10,101,00:08:23,this is nuts.
10,102,00:08:25,"he covered himself with these things, just in case!"
10,103,00:08:30,not bad.
10,104,00:08:32,you're a magician through and through.
10,105,00:08:38,"he may have blocked it with those bags, but he's severely injured."
10,106,00:08:42,damn it.
10,107,00:08:44,we have to catch the attacker!
10,108,00:08:46,but who could have donesuch a terrible thing?
10,109,00:08:54,i'm going to go investigate!
10,110,00:09:16,big news!
10,111,00:09:18,i found out who it was!
10,112,00:09:21,"good going, great detective suika."
10,113,00:09:25,i know who's behind the murder of asagiri gen!
10,114,00:09:29,"uh, he's not dead, you know."
10,115,00:09:31,so who was it?
10,116,00:09:33,it was...
10,117,00:09:38,"now that i've killed the sorcerer, i, magma-sama, am the most powerful!"
10,118,00:09:44,fighting sorcery is no more of a challenge than twisting a baby's arm.
10,119,00:09:49,yeah! indeed!
10,120,00:09:52,it's a shame i couldn't kill kohaku herself.
10,121,00:09:56,she's just too well-prepared.
10,122,00:09:58,she's way too strong for a woman.
10,123,00:10:02,it must be sorcery.
10,124,00:10:06,"but now that i've gotten rid of her powerful sorcerer ally,"
10,125,00:10:10,kohaku is just another girl.
10,126,00:10:15,"though, if she apologizes tearfully,"
10,127,00:10:16,"i wouldn't mind making her mine, along with ruri."
10,128,00:10:20,how lucky the siblings are to have the privilege of belonging to magma!
10,129,00:10:26,this is really bad news!
10,130,00:10:30,magma did it? that bastard!
10,131,00:10:33,i see...
10,132,00:10:34,asagiri gen made those flowers disappear before their eyes.
10,133,00:10:38,"from magma's perspective,"
10,134,00:10:40,gen is the rumored outsider sorcerer that i brought with me.
10,135,00:10:45,so magma stabbed gen because he mistook him for senku?
10,136,00:10:50,"it's a real insult that magma believes my strength is due to sorcery, though."
10,137,00:10:55,"well, you have the raw power of an actual gorilla."
10,138,00:10:58,so you're a legit gorilla.
10,139,00:11:01,i'm sorry.
10,140,00:11:03,"so why is magma looking for an opportunity to kill you, kohaku?"
10,141,00:11:10,"probably... no, definitely because of..."
10,142,00:11:13,the grand bout.
10,143,00:11:16,"once every generation,"
10,144,00:11:17,the village holds a large martial arts battle called the grand bout.
10,145,00:11:23,so that's what that arena-looking thing on the far island is for.
10,146,00:11:27,"several months ago,"
10,147,00:11:29,"on the day that the village priestess, ruri-nee, came of age..."
10,148,00:11:37,the winner of the grand bout was to wed her and become the village elder.
10,149,00:11:42,that's also how my father became the current village elder.
10,150,00:11:51,the winner is magma.
10,151,00:11:53,on to the finals!
10,152,00:11:55,"damn, magma's unstoppable."
10,153,00:11:58,yeah!
10,154,00:12:00,ruri!
10,155,00:12:03,"hey, are you all right, ruri?"
10,156,00:12:05,hold it.
10,157,00:12:06,don't just approach the priestess so casually.
10,158,00:12:16,"ruri, huh?"
10,159,00:12:18,"well, she's got a year at most."
10,160,00:12:20,i don't want to take care of her.
10,161,00:12:22,"if she'd just go ahead and croak,"
10,162,00:12:24,i could take the elder's seat without all the trouble.
10,163,00:12:27,maybe i ought to make it
10,164,00:12:29,look like she drowned herself out of despair in her sickness.
10,165,00:12:39,mercy!
10,166,00:12:40,the winner of the grand bout is kohaku.
10,167,00:12:43,"magma, i cannot allow a man like you to have ruri-nee."
10,168,00:12:49,kohaku... this kid...
10,169,00:12:51,she joined the grand bout just to stop me!
10,170,00:12:55,"wait, what happens now?"
10,171,00:12:57,"the rules say the winner is supposed to marry ruri-nee, so..."
10,172,00:13:02,ruri-chan and kohaku-chan are going to get married?!
10,173,00:13:07,it's forbidden love!
10,174,00:13:10,obviously not.
10,175,00:13:10,{\an8}ouchie!
10,176,00:13:12,"jeez, what do we do now?"
10,177,00:13:14,who's going to marry ruri-sama?
10,178,00:13:18,"is that why your old man, the elder, disowned you?"
10,179,00:13:22,"no... well, that was the last straw, but..."
10,180,00:13:26,kohaku has caused a ton of trouble ever since she was little.
10,181,00:13:31,"of course, the grand bout is set to be redone."
10,182,00:13:33,it's going to be held next month.
10,183,00:13:35,are you saying magma killed gen to win the grand bout?
10,184,00:13:41,so gen really is dead?!
10,185,00:13:43,"no, he's not dead."
10,186,00:13:45,wouldn't it be really bad news if a guy like him became the elder?
10,187,00:13:49,yeah.
10,188,00:13:50,"if magma were to become the elder,"
10,189,00:13:53,it might be hard to even get the medicine to ruri.
10,190,00:13:58,it's also an opportunity.
10,191,00:14:00,"if a man from the kingdom of science defeats magma and wins the grand bout,"
10,192,00:14:04,"marries ruri-nee, and becomes the elder, it'll solve everything."
10,193,00:14:08,rounding up citizens for the kingdom of science
10,194,00:14:10,and giving ruri-nee the cure-all medicine would be easy.
10,195,00:14:16,"kinro, ginro,"
10,196,00:14:18,there's something i want to ask you.
10,197,00:14:21,how do you view ruri-nee?
10,198,00:14:25,would you like to take her as your wife?
10,199,00:14:28,i-i've never even thought about it.
10,200,00:14:31,but ruri-chan—
10,201,00:14:32,"ruri-sama is pretty, and i mean... her face is almost the same as yours, but..."
10,202,00:14:39,"but she's busty— i mean, she's really graceful and cute,"
10,203,00:14:41,"and she has big, round eyes..."
10,204,00:14:43,all you've talked about is about her face.
10,205,00:14:45,do you only ever look at a girl's appearance?
10,206,00:14:47,"you're utterly shallow, ginro."
10,207,00:14:50,"c-come on, i said she's bus— she's bu— she's graceful!"
10,208,00:14:55,my answer is simple.
10,209,00:14:57,the gatekeeper doesn't ask questions.
10,210,00:14:59,rules are rules.
10,211,00:15:01,but listening to one murmur to themselves is not against the rules.
10,212,00:15:07,i already understand that senku isn't evil.
10,213,00:15:13,"you can skip the explanation, as usual."
10,214,00:15:16,what's your objective?
10,215,00:15:23,i want to save my sister's life.
10,216,00:15:35,all right.
10,217,00:15:37,you don't need to explain further.
10,218,00:15:40,too shallow!
10,219,00:15:41,do you really think you can defeat magma like that?
10,220,00:15:45,let's take a break!
10,221,00:15:48,no!
10,222,00:15:48,finish three more sets first!
10,223,00:15:50,hold it!
10,224,00:15:58,chrome.
10,225,00:16:00,i'd really prefer to train you more than anyone.
10,226,00:16:03,but kinro and ginro are the only ones who have a chance of defeating magma.
10,227,00:16:09,i'm sorry.
10,228,00:16:11,"yo, chrome, she's being all ""sorry, sorry!"" about our plan"
10,229,00:16:15,to get kinro or ginro to marry ruri
10,230,00:16:17,because you're in love with her.
10,231,00:16:19,you're as brutal as ever.
10,232,00:16:27,this place is amazing!
10,233,00:16:30,"hey, ruri!"
10,234,00:16:33,i'm okay.
10,235,00:16:34,is it the usual thing again?
10,236,00:16:38,"chrome, they told me i'm not going to get better."
10,237,00:16:43,i'm not going to live to become an adult.
10,238,00:16:46,"i'll take care of it, ruri."
10,239,00:16:48,i'll look for whatever i can.
10,240,00:16:50,i promise i'll cure you someday!
10,241,00:16:59,yeah.
10,242,00:17:00,i'm totally cool with that.
10,243,00:17:04,i can ask for nothing more than the cure-all
10,244,00:17:07,science drug to save ruri so she can live a good life.
10,245,00:17:11,"i'm the genius sciencer, after all."
10,246,00:17:17,"job-changing from a sorcerer to a sciencer, huh?"
10,247,00:17:20,yeah. i'm not calling myself a sorcerer anymore.
10,248,00:17:23,let's let the battle team deal with the grand bout
10,249,00:17:26,"while we, the science team, focus on making the sulfa drug."
10,250,00:17:30,heck yeah!
10,251,00:17:38,i plan on participating in the grand bout.
10,252,00:17:41,"the kingdom of science team, with kinro, ginro and me,"
10,253,00:17:44,will do whatever it takes to stop magma's victory.
10,254,00:17:47,yeah.
10,255,00:17:50,"hey, gen, are you all right?"
10,256,00:17:52,his recovery is going to take a long time at this rate.
10,257,00:17:56,which means...
10,258,00:17:57,yeah.
10,259,00:17:59,we have a short time limit before tsukasa comes to kill me.
10,260,00:18:39,i'm still sleepy!
10,261,00:18:42,"wake up, ginro."
10,262,00:18:44,you just agreed to do morning training until we rotate on our guard duty.
10,263,00:18:47,"oh, no!"
10,264,00:18:49,gen's vanished!
10,265,00:18:56,"yeah, i'm sure he went back to tsukasa."
10,266,00:19:01,but why would he sneak out like that?
10,267,00:19:03,that bat bastard better not intend to tell tsukasa that senku's alive.
10,268,00:19:09,"this is bad, senku."
10,269,00:19:10,we have to go after him.
10,270,00:19:32,"wait, tsukasa-chan! it's me!"
10,271,00:19:37,tsukasa-chan!
10,272,00:19:38,i found a primitive village.
10,273,00:19:41,i got in a fight with them and ended up just slightly injured.
10,274,00:19:50,and senku-chan was...
10,275,00:19:54,"we have to catch the bat bastard, quick."
10,276,00:19:58,hold it!
10,277,00:20:03,"why are you stopping me, senku?"
10,278,00:20:05,we have to catch the bat bastard!
10,279,00:20:08,we can leave him be.
10,280,00:20:11,"if gen really didn't have a millimeter of interest in science,"
10,281,00:20:16,he never would have cooperated to begin with.
10,282,00:20:20,he'd already made up his mind on whose side he was on when i made electricity.
10,283,00:20:27,"but as a superficial man, he has his superficial ways of saving face."
10,284,00:20:34,"men are such a pain in the ass,"
10,285,00:20:37,in any era.
10,286,00:20:40,this is making me thirsty for a drink.
10,287,00:20:45,"like, say, cola."
10,288,00:20:47,"can you make it in this stone world, senku-chan?"
10,289,00:20:54,can you make a bottle of cola?
10,290,00:21:01,"yeah, i can."
10,291,00:21:03,even if no one else can.
10,292,00:21:12,senku-chan... was gone without a trace.
10,293,00:21:19,"he's dead, without a doubt."
10,294,00:21:24,so gen's joining the kingdom of science?
10,295,00:21:26,yeah.
10,296,00:21:27,i'm sure he'll wander back like nothing happened.
10,297,00:21:31,"looks like the first battle between the tsukasa empire and the kingdom of science,"
10,298,00:21:34,"the fight for asagiri gen, ends in victory for the kingdom of science."
10,299,00:21:38,gen is a good person after all!
10,300,00:21:41,yeah!
10,301,00:21:43,"it's the world's flimsiest alliance, bound by a single bottle of cola."
10,302,00:21:50,"man, this really isn't worth it."
10,303,00:21:54,all for a single bottle of cola...
10,304,00:21:57,"i hope it's super well-cooled, at least."
10,305,00:22:02,"all right, damn it."
10,306,00:22:04,i'll have to apply science to make gen a ridiculously chilled
10,307,00:22:07,bottle of cola in time for when he gets back.
10,308,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
10,309,00:23:58,{\an8}clear world
10,310,00:24:00,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
11,1,00:00:11,your strike is too shallow!
11,2,00:00:14,one of us must win the grand bout so that
11,3,00:00:18,we can give ruri-nee the cure-all medicine!
11,4,00:00:23,"all right, so while gen's out deceiving tsukasa,"
11,5,00:00:27,let's get started on that cure-all drug.
11,6,00:00:29,yeah!
11,7,00:00:30,what are we making with science next?
11,8,00:00:33,there's a material that's just as important for building a civilization as iron.
11,9,00:00:38,"the first man-made material in history, synthesized using science..."
11,10,00:00:43,glass.
11,11,00:00:48,what's that?
11,12,00:00:50,aren't we gonna make all sorts of drugs
11,13,00:00:51,now that we have electricity and all that?
11,14,00:00:54,"yeah, we are."
11,15,00:00:56,clay pots are no longer going to cut it
11,16,00:00:58,for our happy chemistry experiments if we want to make the cure-all sulfa drug.
11,17,00:01:02,glass can stand up to just about any chemical.
11,18,00:01:05,glass is the foundation of chemistry.
11,19,00:01:09,ten billion percent easy to process!
11,20,00:01:11,yet it's tough as hell and durable!
11,21,00:01:14,"you can even see through it, which means you can observe the chemicals inside."
11,22,00:01:18,"really? oh, man."
11,23,00:01:22,"to top it all off, once we have glass,"
11,24,00:01:25,we might finally get a chance to yank that headpiece
11,25,00:01:28,off of great detective suika and see her true face.
11,26,00:01:34,11.0vision
11,27,00:01:34,"wait, senku!"
11,28,00:01:35,suika doesn't want her face to be seen!
11,29,00:01:38,take a good look.
11,30,00:01:42,"wow, suika! you're perfectly adorable!"
11,31,00:01:48,what the hell?!
11,32,00:01:51,"good morning, world"
11,33,00:01:53,good morning world!
11,34,00:01:54,good morning world!
11,35,00:02:07,how far have i walked?
11,36,00:02:09,only the pain in my feet
11,37,00:02:13,gives me a sense of the distance
11,38,00:02:17,the hope for a beautiful view at the end of a long night
11,39,00:02:23,is what keeps me going today
11,40,00:02:28,"the mountains of the gods, the palaces of green"
11,41,00:02:33,"the depths of the caves, the ends of the deep blue sky"
11,42,00:02:38,"i'll go the full distance, there are no limits"
11,43,00:02:43,to the ends of the world
11,44,00:02:49,"good morning, world"
11,45,00:02:50,good morning world!
11,46,00:02:52,good morning world!
11,47,00:02:53,rid away the impossibility of the dark
11,48,00:02:57,an odyssey turning mythology into the everyday
11,49,00:03:03,"in this painstaking journey, turning over every stone"
11,50,00:03:13,we'll expand our world
11,51,00:03:26,i have the fuzzy sickness in my eyes.
11,52,00:03:29,"everything looks fuzzy to me,"
11,53,00:03:32,"so i end up looking like this when i try really hard to see, and it's embarrassing."
11,54,00:03:38,"but with this mask, for some reason, it's a little easier to see!"
11,55,00:03:43,"yeah, that's the pinhole effect."
11,56,00:03:46,nearsighted
11,57,00:03:46,"{\an8}if you look at an object through a small hole,"
11,58,00:03:46,normal
11,59,00:03:49,"{\an8}the light passing through it narrows,bringing it into focus."
11,60,00:03:53,what does glass have to do with suika's fuzzy sickness?
11,61,00:03:57,it has ten billion percent to do with it!
11,62,00:03:59,"listen up, suika."
11,63,00:04:01,you're nearsighted as hell.
11,64,00:04:05,that's not a disease.
11,65,00:04:07,it's not even a defect.
11,66,00:04:10,"in a technological civilization, it doesn't even bother anyone."
11,67,00:04:14,"we have eyes of science, made from glass."
11,68,00:04:17,"they're called glasses, and they solve everything."
11,69,00:04:22,science users can make eyes?
11,70,00:04:27,that's so amazing.
11,71,00:04:30,yeah.
11,72,00:04:33,"if i could, i'd love to see the beauty of the world, too."
11,73,00:04:39,even if it's just once.
11,74,00:04:42,i want to meet you guys without the fuzziness.
11,75,00:04:47,"i want to meet the real you, just once."
11,76,00:04:52,all right.
11,77,00:04:53,let's make this glass stuff!
11,78,00:04:56,yeah.
11,79,00:04:57,"what do we need to gather, senku?"
11,80,00:05:00,glass is made mostly from quartz sand.
11,81,00:05:06,"i didn't see any in the chrome collection, actually."
11,82,00:05:09,i'm not going to collect sand.
11,83,00:05:11,"i did see a hint that'll lead us to quartz sand, though."
11,84,00:05:17,this was the place.
11,85,00:05:19,this is where i found this translucent rock as a kid.
11,86,00:05:22,that little tidbit is worth a ton.
11,87,00:05:27,"that translucent rock, that crystal,"
11,88,00:05:30,"tends to be found in areas of decayed granite, like this place."
11,89,00:05:35,and all this sand here is the raw material for glass:
11,90,00:05:40,quartz sand.
11,91,00:05:43,"yo, the white grains are falling out like crazy!"
11,92,00:05:47,this is fun!
11,93,00:05:49,we'll get loads here.
11,94,00:05:51,try to gather the see-through ones.
11,95,00:05:59,we grind down all the quartz sand into fine grains.
11,96,00:06:05,then we mix it with a bunch of other stuff and melt it in the stove.
11,97,00:06:08,what else do we need?
11,98,00:06:10,we already have everything we need.
11,99,00:06:13,thanks to all of our efforts so far.
11,100,00:06:15,"ten percent calcium carbonate, or sea shells."
11,101,00:06:20,twenty percent cooked seaweed.
11,102,00:06:23,we used all this stuff when we made soap.
11,103,00:06:33,now...
11,104,00:06:35,all right! galena!
11,105,00:06:37,lead acquired!
11,106,00:06:39,"we just need to throw in some lead, and we have super see-through lens glass."
11,107,00:06:48,"it's shiny and see-through, like ice!"
11,108,00:06:51,it's like a gem.
11,109,00:06:54,that's a weird-looking tool.
11,110,00:06:56,we'd die if we tried to polish glass by hand.
11,111,00:07:00,we can use that super tough corundum for polishing.
11,112,00:07:06,glass has a mohs hardness of about 6.
11,113,00:07:09,corundum's is 9.
11,114,00:07:11,polishing will be a piece of cake!
11,115,00:07:13,here they go again with their stone talk.
11,116,00:07:13,"{\an8}and the strongest is diamond, with a hardness of 10."
11,117,00:07:15,i can't keep up with them.
11,118,00:07:16,{\an8}diamond is nuts!
11,119,00:07:17,{\an8}that's insane!
11,120,00:08:11,"suika, can you see what's in front of you?"
11,121,00:08:16,they're just sunflowers.
11,122,00:08:19,"it's not like i can't see at all, you know."
11,123,00:09:26,again.
11,124,00:09:27,why is your final strike so shallow?
11,125,00:09:29,"it's your worst habit, kinro."
11,126,00:09:32,distance is crucial in spear fighting.
11,127,00:09:34,"if you can't get a good sense of distance, you'll never defeat magma."
11,128,00:09:42,"distance, huh?"
11,129,00:09:48,"what can you do, though, right?"
11,130,00:09:52,"i mean, you have the fuzzy sickness."
11,131,00:09:57,that's why you ended up with such a menacing look.
11,132,00:10:01,i was born that way.
11,133,00:10:02,i don't get it.
11,134,00:10:04,"i'd just tell her, straight-up."
11,135,00:10:07,"""it's not my fault."
11,136,00:10:09,"it's my eyes. i'm actually way stronger."""
11,137,00:10:14,excuses are unbecoming of a grown man.
11,138,00:10:17,"don't tell anyone, ginro."
11,139,00:10:23,"you're both surprisingly good-looking, senku and chrome."
11,140,00:10:27,"what do you mean, ""surprisingly""? jeez."
11,141,00:10:30,"next, we're finally making glass instruments."
11,142,00:10:33,"now that suika's labor potential has leveled up super high,"
11,143,00:10:37,we're going to put together a full chemistry set.
11,144,00:10:40,"don't call her ""labor potential""!"
11,145,00:10:42,just let it end as a feel-good story!
11,146,00:10:45,{\an8}what are you laughing about?!
11,147,00:10:46,{\an4}acquired glass!!
11,148,00:10:56,it's time for our fun glasswork class!
11,149,00:10:59,let's get working!
11,150,00:11:02,"we're throwing these black rocks in, right?"
11,151,00:11:04,i'm going to keep them coming!
11,152,00:11:08,"you've gotten even more nimble, suika."
11,153,00:11:12,"i don't mess up anymore, now that everything isn't fuzzy."
11,154,00:11:16,there's white bubbles coming out.
11,155,00:11:19,this is the foam that's created when you burn obsidian.
11,156,00:11:25,we're using the foam as insulation to make a glassblowing furnace.
11,157,00:11:31,"then we make an iron straw,"
11,158,00:11:35,"then we blow up the glass with air, and that's it."
11,159,00:11:53,"hey, it was our first try."
11,160,00:11:55,"when i first started making clay pots, it took months before they looked decent."
11,161,00:11:59,months?!
11,162,00:12:00,we don't have that much time!
11,163,00:12:02,"i'm worried about ruri-nee's health, too."
11,164,00:12:05,i'm not a glass craftsman.
11,165,00:12:07,trial and error is all we've got.
11,166,00:12:11,a craftsman?
11,167,00:12:23,"hey, cut it out, chrome!"
11,168,00:12:27,who the hell is that old fart?
11,169,00:12:30,"come on, old man kaseki!"
11,170,00:12:32,we could really use your skills!
11,171,00:12:34,is this how you ask for favors?
11,172,00:12:37,by tying them up for your kinky rope play?
11,173,00:12:40,i'm not lending a single hand to your shady sorcery!
11,174,00:12:45,see? he just won't come and help us.
11,175,00:12:48,grandpa kaseki...
11,176,00:12:51,i forgot to return your lacquer.
11,177,00:12:54,"oh, that's right."
11,178,00:12:57,"old man, were you the one who made that fantastic, seasoned shield?"
11,179,00:13:03,with no iron tools and hardly any dyes to speak of?
11,180,00:13:07,"it was a gift from when kohaku's father, kokuyo, won in the grand bout."
11,181,00:13:15,i went all-out when i made it.
11,182,00:13:18,"gosh, that really takes me back..."
11,183,00:13:27,"the construction is ridiculously advanced for the technology,"
11,184,00:13:30,so i had a feeling there must be a really good craftsman.
11,185,00:13:34,but i never thought it'd be such a worn-out old fart.
11,186,00:13:37,"is that awesome suspension bridge your handiwork, too?"
11,187,00:13:40,"yeah, that's right."
11,188,00:13:42,and you had the gall to pull the planks out!
11,189,00:13:44,i'm never going to help you...
11,190,00:13:48,wh-what's this translucent stonework here?
11,191,00:13:54,you don't have to help us if you don't want to.
11,192,00:13:56,just sit there and watch.
11,193,00:13:59,"you're going to love this, kaseki."
11,194,00:14:02,this is going to be ten billion percent exhilarating for you.
11,195,00:14:09,i see. heat makes it pliable and soft.
11,196,00:14:13,it's like blubber.
11,197,00:14:17,what ease of molding!
11,198,00:14:20,"crap, it's too thick again."
11,199,00:14:24,what are you doing?!
11,200,00:14:25,darn it!
11,201,00:14:36,he's not spinning it steadily.
11,202,00:14:39,he's never going to make a good vessel like that.
11,203,00:14:42,"they're not doing this on purpose to provoke me, are they?"
11,204,00:14:46,"ugh, please..."
11,205,00:14:51,there's no way a man who's spent his whole life as a maker
11,206,00:14:55,is going to stay put in front of something as drooltastic as glassblowing.
11,207,00:15:01,"am i right, old man kaseki?"
11,208,00:15:05,this is unbearable!
11,209,00:15:10,"you got me good, damn it!"
11,210,00:15:15,let me handle this.
11,211,00:15:18,are you serious with those muscles?
11,212,00:15:38,"suika, water."
11,213,00:15:40,got it!
11,214,00:15:48,"oh, man! oh, damn!"
11,215,00:15:51,isn't this your first time seeing glass?
11,216,00:15:55,he's got far more years of craftwork experience.
11,217,00:16:00,"i've been a craftsman for fifty years, believe it or not."
11,218,00:16:02,i'm kind of a big deal.
11,219,00:16:06,there are people like you in every age.
11,220,00:16:09,"dudes with true talent, who've spent their whole lives"
11,221,00:16:13,"with their heads down, dedicated to their work."
11,222,00:16:28,{\an4}acquired science lab!!
11,223,00:16:36,sweet!
11,224,00:16:52,"hey, what's the matter, senku?"
11,225,00:16:54,we finally have a lab now!
11,226,00:16:56,show some joy!
11,227,00:16:58,"yeah, sure. yippee."
11,228,00:17:03,we're just at the dawn of chemistry.
11,229,00:17:06,things are starting to look pretty fancy
11,230,00:17:09,"here in our kingdom of science,"
11,231,00:17:11,chock full of attractions ten billion times more fun than tsukasa land.
11,232,00:17:19,{\an8}kingdom of science map
11,233,00:17:22,long time no see!
11,234,00:17:24,i'm mecha senku!
11,235,00:17:26,here's an overview of the kingdom of science!
11,236,00:17:30,this is the kingdom's home base.
11,237,00:17:32,it's a mountain of the minerals that chrome
11,238,00:17:34,has been collecting since he was a kid.
11,239,00:17:38,i've got tons of crazy treasures.
11,240,00:17:40,{\an8}kingdom of science map
11,241,00:17:45,"our familiar gourmet science dish, foxtail millet ramen!"
11,242,00:17:49,i can eat bowl after bowl!
11,243,00:17:51,it's so good!
11,244,00:17:52,and it's just so good!
11,245,00:17:55,{\an8}kingdom of science map
11,246,00:17:58,we rely on having power in numbers to make iron.
11,247,00:18:02,"to 1,500 degrees and beyond!"
11,248,00:18:05,"hey, hey, this is really rough."
11,249,00:18:10,{\an8}kingdom of science map
11,250,00:18:17,down with magma!
11,251,00:18:18,these are the training grounds of hell!
11,252,00:18:20,"actually, it's just an open area."
11,253,00:18:22,friendship! hard work! victory!
11,254,00:18:24,you're not one to talk!
11,255,00:18:26,"you're the lowest of the low, ginro!"
11,256,00:18:31,the elbow grease generator.
11,257,00:18:33,it's the ultimate in green energy!
11,258,00:18:35,{\an8}kingdom of science map
11,259,00:18:42,blowing glass with the skill of an artisan.
11,260,00:18:45,it bends like clay.
11,261,00:18:52,the scorching hot glass is cooled slowly so that it doesn't crack.
11,262,00:19:00,and this is the laboratory.
11,263,00:19:03,we're charging down the sulfa drug route with all kinds of insane chemicals.
11,264,00:19:09,{\an8}kingdom of science map
11,265,00:19:16,"it's kind of spectacular, isn't it?"
11,266,00:19:19,this kingdom of science is starting to heat up.
11,267,00:19:23,we've only made the bare essentials.
11,268,00:19:26,we wouldn't get anywhere if we were missing any one of these.
11,269,00:19:31,was the technology even crazier before the world collapsed?
11,270,00:19:36,yeah.
11,271,00:19:38,it took two million years to get there.
11,272,00:19:41,and we're going to catch up and run past it.
11,273,00:19:50,our first step is the cure-all sulfa drug.
11,274,00:20:00,{\an8}yay!
11,275,00:20:01,yay!
11,276,00:20:02,{\an8}yay!
11,277,00:20:02,yay!
11,278,00:20:03,{\an8}yay!
11,279,00:20:04,yay!
11,280,00:20:04,{\an8}yay!
11,281,00:20:05,yay!
11,282,00:20:06,the sorcery team's so lucky.
11,283,00:20:09,they look like they're having so much fun with shiny stuff.
11,284,00:20:12,it's not like we're...
11,285,00:20:14,"hey, kinro, what if..."
11,286,00:20:17,what if the spear tip were super shiny?
11,287,00:20:20,"don't you think it would help you practice,"
11,288,00:20:22,since you could get a better sense of distance with your fuzzy vision?
11,289,00:20:28,"what are you talking about, ginro?"
11,290,00:20:33,huh?
11,291,00:20:34,"hey, speaking of shiny..."
11,292,00:20:37,don't you think we should have a golden spear and silver spear?
11,293,00:20:42,"strictly for the grand bout, of course."
11,294,00:20:44,"we'll totally need them to win, won't we?"
11,295,00:20:57,i don't know anything about fighting.
11,296,00:21:00,is it true that a gold and silver spear will help them beat magma?
11,297,00:21:04,"senku, to borrow your words,"
11,298,00:21:08,they ten billion percent just want gold and silver spears.
11,299,00:21:12,"i mean, now that you have all this... glass, was it?"
11,300,00:21:16,and this amazing laboratory...
11,301,00:21:18,"i thought maybe you could make a silver spear, you know."
11,302,00:21:22,and then taking down magma will be easy-peasy.
11,303,00:21:27,that's right.
11,304,00:21:28,"now that we have glassware,"
11,305,00:21:31,we're going to have to suck it up and go get
11,306,00:21:34,the most difficult material to obtain.
11,307,00:21:38,all right.
11,308,00:21:40,let's break in this brand new laboratory by making a silver spear.
11,309,00:21:47,"i'm sorry, kinro."
11,310,00:21:49,i have a way of becoming everyone's favorite.
11,311,00:21:53,"you aren't the slightest bit my favorite, idiot."
11,312,00:21:55,"this could literally cost you your life, ginro."
11,313,00:22:01,we're off on a great adventure to find
11,314,00:22:05,chemistry's greatest treasure.
11,315,00:22:09,you'll be putting your life on the line in a maximum danger area.
11,316,00:22:13,you could seriously die there in an instant.
11,317,00:22:45,maybe i don't know what to do　　
11,318,00:22:47,"hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　"
11,319,00:22:50,flying up to where the wind blew
11,320,00:22:53,in my hands awakens
11,321,00:22:55,the passion overflowing
11,322,00:22:57,just wandering through this world
11,323,00:22:59,your one shining pure
11,324,00:23:01,could never be pierced with a rusty knife
11,325,00:23:03,i'm burning like a fire gone wild
11,326,00:23:05,the moment an arrow shot through my heart
11,327,00:23:07,the noise plaguing me was released
11,328,00:23:10,everything was different from that moment on
11,329,00:23:12,"if i don't try, i'll never know"
11,330,00:23:15,why do flowers bloom?
11,331,00:23:20,your voice echoes
11,332,00:23:24,tell me why?
11,333,00:23:26,i just shouted to the sky　　
11,334,00:23:28,"but you are no no no longer here, that's right?"
11,335,00:23:30,the life we confirmed that day
11,336,00:23:35,you can call it a fleeting dream if you want
11,337,00:23:41,but i'll save you from a wounded today
11,338,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
11,339,00:23:58,{\an8}buddies back to back
12,1,00:00:07,so this thin hair-like stuff is going to turn into silver?
12,2,00:00:10,damn... i thought they were roots from some plant.
12,3,00:00:19,"that's going to become my silver spear, huh?"
12,4,00:00:22,"man, science sure is strange, isn't it?"
12,5,00:00:26,speaking of which...
12,6,00:00:28,"kinro, you already got your golden spear, ri—"
12,7,00:00:32,"oh, wait..."
12,8,00:00:33,sorry! i didn't notice.
12,9,00:00:35,"who would have thought we'd only get a silver spear, and not a gold one?"
12,10,00:00:39,"ginro, move your arms, not your mouth!"
12,11,00:00:44,"hang on, though."
12,12,00:00:45,why are you only making a silver spear?
12,13,00:00:48,because we need it to get the maximum danger materials.
12,14,00:00:56,yes!
12,15,00:00:57,i finally have a silver spear!
12,16,00:00:59,"yay! thanks, senku!"
12,17,00:00:59,{\an8}yippee! yippee!
12,18,00:01:04,you don't owe me one millimeter of thanks.
12,19,00:01:07,i didn't make that for you.
12,20,00:01:10,"come on, let's get moving."
12,21,00:01:12,{\an8}bodyguard ginro
12,22,00:01:12,"ginro, your job is to be the team's bodyguard."
12,23,00:01:19,bodyguard! bodyguard!
12,24,00:01:21,i'm a bodyguard!
12,25,00:01:23,i'm ginro!
12,26,00:01:25,{\an8}i'm ginro!
12,27,00:01:25,"hey, this is the hot spring area that i draw hot water from all the time."
12,28,00:01:30,"i came all prepared because you said it was going to be ""maximum danger."""
12,29,00:01:33,it gets dangerous up ahead.
12,30,00:01:36,"ginro, quit messing around and hold your spear forward."
12,31,00:01:40,huh?
12,32,00:01:41,this silver spear is a sensor.
12,33,00:01:43,that's what i made it for.
12,34,00:01:46,take a good look at the tip.
12,35,00:01:48,if that silver spear turns black...
12,36,00:01:53,if it turns black...?
12,37,00:01:57,"a few seconds later, you'll be dead."
12,38,00:02:03,you need to get away within 0.1 seconds.
12,39,00:02:06,"we'll all run, too."
12,40,00:02:08,the enemy we're about to go up against will send us
12,41,00:02:11,to the afterlife with just one mistake.
12,42,00:02:13,this is the greatest hurdle in making sulfa drugs.
12,43,00:02:21,"good morning, world"
12,44,00:02:23,good morning world!
12,45,00:02:24,good morning world!
12,46,00:02:37,how far have i walked?
12,47,00:02:39,only the pain in my feet
12,48,00:02:43,gives me a sense of the distance
12,49,00:02:47,the hope for a beautiful view at the end of a long night
12,50,00:02:53,is what keeps me going today
12,51,00:02:57,"the mountains of the gods, the palaces of green"
12,52,00:03:03,"the depths of the caves, the ends of the deep blue sky"
12,53,00:03:08,"i'll go the full distance, there are no limits"
12,54,00:03:13,to the ends of the world
12,55,00:03:19,"good morning, world"
12,56,00:03:20,good morning world!
12,57,00:03:22,good morning world!
12,58,00:03:23,rid away the impossibility of the dark
12,59,00:03:27,an odyssey turning mythology into the everyday
12,60,00:03:33,"in this painstaking journey, turning over every stone"
12,61,00:03:43,we'll expand our world
12,62,00:03:51,{\an8}buddies back to back
12,63,00:03:56,there isn't a single fish in this river.
12,64,00:03:59,i know.
12,65,00:04:00,nothing but emerald green liverwort.
12,66,00:04:03,this is it for sure.
12,67,00:04:04,our goal is upstream from here.
12,68,00:04:07,so the greatest hurdle is up ahead...
12,69,00:04:10,it's okay.
12,70,00:04:15,it's okay.
12,71,00:04:17,it's okay. it's not black yet.
12,72,00:04:19,it's okay.
12,73,00:04:21,it's okay.
12,74,00:04:22,it's okay.
12,75,00:04:24,it's ok—
12,76,00:04:26,"what the hell is the sensor doing walking at the back, ginro?!"
12,77,00:04:30,"well, you said i was gonna die!"
12,78,00:04:31,i'm scared!
12,79,00:04:34,"want to switch places with me, then?"
12,80,00:04:36,hand over the silver spear.
12,81,00:04:37,never!
12,82,00:04:38,i'll do it!
12,83,00:04:39,"i'll do it, all right?!"
12,84,00:04:42,it's okay.
12,85,00:04:44,it's okay...
12,86,00:04:47,i-i-i-it's okay...
12,87,00:04:49,it's okay...
12,88,00:04:50,it's okay...
12,89,00:04:52,it's—
12,90,00:04:54,"chrome, senku, kohaku-chan..."
12,91,00:05:01,"we're here, senku."
12,92,00:05:03,i knew it.
12,93,00:05:05,we've found the source of the materials that were our greatest hurdle.
12,94,00:05:09,"i don't even know what we're here to gather,"
12,95,00:05:13,but i can at least appreciate that this is our goal.
12,96,00:05:16,it's so divine and beautiful...
12,97,00:05:20,an entire spring of emerald green.
12,98,00:05:46,"what's up, senku?"
12,99,00:05:47,is this not our goal?
12,100,00:05:49,"no, it is."
12,101,00:05:51,this is perfect.
12,102,00:05:53,it's this green water that we're here to collect.
12,103,00:05:56,but the geography bugs me.
12,104,00:05:58,"the poison gases that form here,"
12,105,00:06:01,"hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, are heavier than air."
12,106,00:06:05,they settle in dips like this one.
12,107,00:06:08,is that what the silver spear's supposed to warn us about?
12,108,00:06:12,yeah.
12,109,00:06:13,silver reacts with hydrogen sulfide and turns black instantly...
12,110,00:06:31,"get back, ginro!"
12,111,00:06:53,how could you tell?!
12,112,00:06:55,i was so close to giving you eternal slumber!
12,113,00:07:01,go away!
12,114,00:07:02,calm down! there's no one there!
12,115,00:07:03,"there's no one there, ginro!"
12,116,00:07:08,it melted.
12,117,00:07:09,the bird's wing...
12,118,00:07:11,"what's the deal with this spring's water, senku?!"
12,119,00:07:16,"it was discovered around the 8th century, in the midst of alchemy research."
12,120,00:07:20,"in my time, it was a chemical that served as the foundation"
12,121,00:07:23,for all kinds of chemical industries...
12,122,00:07:30,sulfuric acid.
12,123,00:07:32,and we can't make the cure-all drug for ruri without this sulfuric acid stuff?
12,124,00:07:37,nope.
12,125,00:07:38,"we need to secure a source of sulfuric acid anyway,"
12,126,00:07:40,or chemistry won't develop any further.
12,127,00:07:44,we'll have to push our way through to gather some.
12,128,00:07:47,i'll risk my life as many times as it takes to save ruri-nee.
12,129,00:07:51,with my speed...
12,130,00:07:54,"back in my age, there was a group"
12,131,00:07:56,that went to do research around an area of sulfuric acid like this one.
12,132,00:08:01,"the man in front knelt for a moment, maybe to tie his shoelaces."
12,133,00:08:07,"sensei, what's wrong?"
12,134,00:08:13,he was dead.
12,135,00:08:16,there was hydrogen sulfide at his head's height when he knelt.
12,136,00:08:19,this is an accident that actually happened.
12,137,00:08:22,humans don't stand a chance when mother nature wants us dead.
12,138,00:08:27,"it doesn't matter how stupidly fast you are, kohaku."
12,139,00:08:30,"then what are we supposed to do, senku?"
12,140,00:08:33,"i have to save ruri-nee, no matter what!"
12,141,00:08:35,what else?
12,142,00:08:38,we're going to make gas masks.
12,143,00:08:43,the only way to fight a chemical enemy is with chemistry.
12,144,00:08:51,we'll have to see how much poison we can breathe through this.
12,145,00:08:54,we can't rely on trial and error this time.
12,146,00:09:00,an error would mean our death.
12,147,00:09:05,"all right, my mask's next."
12,148,00:09:07,you won't need one.
12,149,00:09:12,"chrome, you aren't coming with us to get sulfuric acid anymore."
12,150,00:09:16,stay here.
12,151,00:09:17,what? where's this coming fr—
12,152,00:09:18,shut up and listen.
12,153,00:09:20,these gas masks aren't guaranteed to work.
12,154,00:09:23,who's going to save ruri if all the scientists go down?
12,155,00:09:30,all humans die eventually.
12,156,00:09:32,but knowledge doesn't.
12,157,00:09:35,it's been passed down for two million years.
12,158,00:09:39,"listen up, chrome."
12,159,00:09:41,"i'm going to pass down all the science i know,"
12,160,00:09:44,"all two million years of human civilization, to you, right now."
12,161,00:09:51,"wait, wait, hang on! it's too soon!"
12,162,00:09:53,quit talking like i'm replacing you or something!
12,163,00:09:56,"jeez, that's so ominous!"
12,164,00:09:57,"well, aren't you kind?"
12,165,00:10:00,"what are you, my girlfriend?"
12,166,00:10:03,"i don't have one millimeter of interest in dying, so relax."
12,167,00:10:06,but the only way to cure ruri's disease is to
12,168,00:10:10,charge into the poison gas and get some sulfuric acid.
12,169,00:10:14,"if the two of us do go down together, in that instant,"
12,170,00:10:19,all science will disappear from the face of the earth.
12,171,00:10:27,so i'm staying behind in case you die.
12,172,00:10:31,"yeah, after i pass down all my knowledge of science."
12,173,00:10:38,"i'm not taking it, if that's the case!"
12,174,00:10:43,"what are you, a kid?"
12,175,00:10:45,don't get so fussy about staying home—
12,176,00:10:47,that's not the point!
12,177,00:10:49,i have no intention of helping you with a plan
12,178,00:10:51,that makes it okay for my friend to die!
12,179,00:10:56,"sorry to disappoint you, senku, but i'm not taking your knowledge."
12,180,00:11:01,"so if you croak, it's game over for science!"
12,181,00:11:06,"you're coming back alive, ten billion percent!"
12,182,00:11:10,"you have to, senku!"
12,183,00:11:13,"besides, why are you, the key figure of science,"
12,184,00:11:16,doing the raid through the poison gas?
12,185,00:11:19,just use me or someone else.
12,186,00:11:22,"senku, that's what you would call ""logical."""
12,187,00:11:27,"and yet, you're like, ""chrome, you're staying at home."""
12,188,00:11:29,you seem to think you need to protect me.
12,189,00:11:32,"what am i, your kid?"
12,190,00:11:35,"don't patronize me, asshole."
12,191,00:11:40,"i'm not patronizing anyone, idiot."
12,192,00:11:42,my reasoning is logical.
12,193,00:11:44,i know everything about how the gas mask works
12,194,00:11:48,"and about the materials we're going to get, so our best bet is for me to go."
12,195,00:11:52,that's all.
12,196,00:11:53,that's not our best bet!
12,197,00:11:57,the best bet is for us science users to tag team.
12,198,00:12:01,we can save each other if it comes to that.
12,199,00:12:03,am i wrong?
12,200,00:12:09,"when it comes to ""that,"" we'll already be dead from the poison gas."
12,201,00:12:12,there's no saving each other.
12,202,00:12:14,"b-but there might be, like, an ""oh, shit, my leg's cramping!"" type of situation!"
12,203,00:12:19,"yeah, you're right."
12,204,00:12:22,"it might be just 0.1 percent, but it would raise my chances of survival."
12,205,00:12:29,"taiju and yuzuriha, was it?"
12,206,00:12:32,"they're in the tsukasa empire as spies, right?"
12,207,00:12:35,aren't they putting their lives on the line?
12,208,00:12:37,aren't you and they trusting your lives to each other?
12,209,00:12:41,"if i'm your friend,"
12,210,00:12:42,"neither higher nor lower than you, it's not ""i'll protect you."""
12,211,00:12:48,that's the wrong line!
12,212,00:12:55,"damn it, now we have to make another gas mask, thanks to you."
12,213,00:13:02,"chrome, you can trust me with your life."
12,214,00:13:06,yeah.
12,215,00:13:07,"same to you, senku."
12,216,00:13:13,"kohaku, now that mother is dead, i have to tell you something important."
12,217,00:13:19,do you know what the most important duty of the priestess is?
12,218,00:13:23,the hundred tales.
12,219,00:13:26,the knowledge kept within the hundred stories must be passed down
12,220,00:13:29,"from generation to generation, without fail."
12,221,00:13:33,"you must understand, kohaku."
12,222,00:13:35,ruri won't live long.
12,223,00:13:39,we must avoid the breach of the hundred tales at any cost.
12,224,00:13:43,you're healthy.
12,225,00:13:44,you must be the next priestess after ruri...
12,226,00:13:46,"i'm not going to be the successor, if that's the case."
12,227,00:13:50,i have no intention of helping with a plan that makes it okay for ruri to die!
12,228,00:13:57,"where are you going, kohaku?!"
12,229,00:14:03,"if i'm in a position to take on the priestess's role,"
12,230,00:14:05,ruri-nee will have no reason to keep going.
12,231,00:14:09,that's it! i just need to make father hate me.
12,232,00:14:14,i'll be a rambunctious girl.
12,233,00:14:16,someone utterly unfit to become the priestess.
12,234,00:14:19,i'll carry the healing water.
12,235,00:14:20,"however many thousands of times i have to do it, i'll cure ruri-nee!"
12,236,00:14:30,"chrome, you and i are alike."
12,237,00:14:35,everyone would be mighty happy if ruri-nee were to marry a man like you.
12,238,00:14:42,but the heavens didn't bless you with the ability to fight.
12,239,00:14:46,"god's not very considerate, is he?"
12,240,00:14:50,"if all goes according to our plan, ruri-nee will be marrying kinro or ginro."
12,241,00:14:56,"if it'd be any consolation, would you want me to be your wife in her stead?"
12,242,00:15:05,you're nothing alike.
12,243,00:15:06,"ruri's ladylike, but you're a gorilla."
12,244,00:15:13,see? gorilla.
12,245,00:15:15,"what was that about, anyway?"
12,246,00:15:17,do you have a crush on me or something?
12,247,00:15:19,not in the slightest.
12,248,00:15:21,i didn't think so.
12,249,00:15:22,so don't say stuff like that.
12,250,00:15:27,this is the same as when we made edison's light bulb.
12,251,00:15:30,"first, we steam-roast some bamboo."
12,252,00:15:32,"you can use glass that way, too?"
12,253,00:15:35,"add potassium carbonate, which is extracted from ash."
12,254,00:15:38,we also used this to make ramen.
12,255,00:15:42,"that gives us this black powder,"
12,256,00:15:44,"activated charcoal, mixed well with potassium carbonate."
12,257,00:15:47,it'll neutralize and catch the poison gas.
12,258,00:15:50,now we have a chemical barrier against poison gas!
12,259,00:15:54,{\an4}acquired gas mask!!
12,260,00:15:55,time for the two of us science users to tag team for a rematch!
12,261,00:16:01,we're gonna get over the greatest hurdle
12,262,00:16:03,and bring home some sulfuric acid for the cure-all drug.
12,263,00:16:21,this is totally the curse of that fairy from the spring!
12,264,00:16:25,that bird died!
12,265,00:16:27,my silver spear turned black!
12,266,00:16:28,i'm never going back there again!
12,267,00:16:32,"damn it, ginro..."
12,268,00:16:34,"come on, let's go!"
12,269,00:16:35,whatever. just stay at home.
12,270,00:16:38,you'll only slow us down.
12,271,00:16:40,but that's not a curse.
12,272,00:16:43,it's science.
12,273,00:16:45,rub the black sulfuric acid sludge
12,274,00:16:46,"with some kind of alkaline base, and it'll turn silver again."
12,275,00:16:49,even rubbing it against the warm ashes will do it.
12,276,00:16:53,the poison gas sensor's back!
12,277,00:16:55,let's get going to the sulfuric acid spring.
12,278,00:17:10,he was dead.
12,279,00:17:12,there are no do-overs.
12,280,00:17:16,do we really stand a chance against this instant-death poison gas?
12,281,00:17:24,holy crap!
12,282,00:17:26,are you seriously just walking up to it?!
12,283,00:17:28,"if you stand around huffing and puffing in fear,"
12,284,00:17:31,you'll end up overwhelming the gas mask's ability to clean the air.
12,285,00:17:36,it's a ridiculously simple concept.
12,286,00:17:38,"freak out too much, and you die."
12,287,00:17:40,now you know. come on.
12,288,00:17:41,"i get the reasoning, but..."
12,289,00:17:44,"damn it, senku, i'm not as ballsy as you—"
12,290,00:18:03,"sheesh, why am i sitting here helping you again?"
12,291,00:18:09,senku and chrome are both wrong.
12,292,00:18:12,how is it not scary?!
12,293,00:18:15,you might die!
12,294,00:18:16,"jeez, i hate it when people do that!"
12,295,00:18:19,"they act all brave, but they're actually reckless!"
12,296,00:18:22,"considering you'd rather run your mouth than shut up and run,"
12,297,00:18:26,i'm guessing you feel like a loser for being so weak.
12,298,00:18:31,i don't...
12,299,00:18:32,"don't worry, ginro."
12,300,00:18:35,you aren't weak at all.
12,301,00:18:39,fear is the secret to a long life.
12,302,00:18:42,isn't it convincing when an old fogy tells you that?
12,303,00:18:46,i used to be a wimp myself.
12,304,00:18:48,"they're really scared inside, too."
12,305,00:18:52,no one is immune to fear.
12,306,00:18:58,that's right.
12,307,00:18:59,"i hadn't thought about it before,"
12,308,00:19:02,but imagine how scary it must be
12,309,00:19:04,"for kinro, with his fuzzy eyes, to go up against magma."
12,310,00:19:09,"but we try to overcome fear for the sake of something dear to us,"
12,311,00:19:12,using reason and willpower.
12,312,00:19:16,"that's what it looks like to me, at least."
12,313,00:19:24,i want to save my sister's life.
12,314,00:19:33,"whoops, i got carried away and made another gas mask."
12,315,00:19:38,"i guess i'll leave it here, since i have no use for it."
12,316,00:20:02,senku!
12,317,00:20:03,the end of your gas mask is melting! it's about to come loose!
12,318,00:20:08,that was a close one.
12,319,00:20:09,good thing we came here together—
12,320,00:20:18,shit.
12,321,00:20:19,this is actually bad.
12,322,00:20:21,senku's trying to catch up to me.
12,323,00:20:24,don't bother.
12,324,00:20:26,there's no chance in hell.
12,325,00:20:28,damn it! it was such a small mistake...
12,326,00:20:32,take care of ruri for me.
12,327,00:20:42,ginro!
12,328,00:20:52,you're too heavy!
12,329,00:20:54,"control your breathing, ginro!"
12,330,00:20:56,your gas mask can't keep up with your air intake.
12,331,00:20:58,it can't?
12,332,00:21:01,is the poison gas going to kill me?
12,333,00:21:02,am i going to die right now?
12,334,00:21:06,all the activated charcoal and potassium carbonate will keep you
12,335,00:21:09,"safe from the poison gas, i promise!"
12,336,00:21:10,as long as you control your breath!
12,337,00:21:12,you can win against the fear!
12,338,00:21:15,isn't that how you came all the way here?
12,339,00:21:19,"yo, ginro."
12,340,00:21:21,think with this... and with this.
12,341,00:21:24,"no matter how powerful nature is,"
12,342,00:21:27,nature doesn't have a heart or a mind to think with!
12,343,00:21:31,that's all we humans have going for us!
12,344,00:21:37,right.
12,345,00:21:39,i'm ginro the bodyguard.
12,346,00:21:42,i'll overcome my fear withmy head and my heart.
12,347,00:22:05,"the tag team between senku and me, the scientists..."
12,348,00:22:09,"...and ginro, the bodyguard..."
12,349,00:22:11,...has overcome the greatest hurdle to making the cure-all drug.
12,350,00:22:14,we've obtained sulfuric acid!
12,351,00:22:16,yeah!
12,352,00:22:17,{\an4}acquired sulfuric acid!!
12,353,00:22:44,maybe i don't know what to do　　
12,354,00:22:47,"hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　"
12,355,00:22:49,flying up to where the wind blew
12,356,00:22:53,in my hands awakens
12,357,00:22:55,the passion overflowing
12,358,00:22:57,just wandering through this world
12,359,00:22:59,your one shining pure
12,360,00:23:01,could never be pierced with a rusty knife
12,361,00:23:03,i'm burning like a fire gone wild
12,362,00:23:05,the moment an arrow shot through my heart
12,363,00:23:07,the noise plaguing me was released
12,364,00:23:10,everything was different from that moment on
12,365,00:23:12,"if i don't try, i'll never know"
12,366,00:23:15,why do flowers bloom?
12,367,00:23:20,your voice echoes
12,368,00:23:24,tell me why?
12,369,00:23:25,i just shouted to the sky　　
12,370,00:23:28,"but you are no no no longer here, that's right?"
12,371,00:23:30,the life we confirmed that day
12,372,00:23:35,you can call it a fleeting dream if you want
12,373,00:23:41,but i'll save you from a wounded today

13,1,00:00:13,welcome back!
13,2,00:00:15,we made it past the biggest hurdle!
13,3,00:00:17,we got sulfuric acid!
13,4,00:00:20,"then, at last, we can make the drug to save ruri-nee?"
13,5,00:00:24,have some patience.
13,6,00:00:26,didn't you see that crazy roadmap to the cure-all drug?
13,7,00:00:31,that incredibly long one?
13,8,00:00:35,it's not that bad.
13,9,00:00:36,we have just about everything we need now.
13,10,00:00:40,we have all the necessary materials.

13,35,00:00:53,time for mad chemical cooking!
13,36,00:00:56,it's gonna be exhilarating!
13,37,00:00:59,"good morning, world"
13,38,00:01:01,good morning world!
13,39,00:01:02,good morning world!
13,40,00:01:15,how far have i walked?
13,41,00:01:17,only the pain in my feet
13,42,00:01:21,gives me a sense of the distance
13,43,00:01:25,the hope for a beautiful view at the end of a long night
13,44,00:01:32,is what keeps me going today
13,45,00:01:36,"the mountains of the gods, the palaces of green"

13,49,00:01:57,"good morning, world"
13,50,00:01:58,good morning world!
13,51,00:02:00,good morning world!
13,52,00:02:01,rid away the impossibility of the dark
13,53,00:02:06,an odyssey turning mythology into the everyday
13,54,00:02:12,"in this painstaking journey, turning over every stone"
13,55,00:02:21,we'll expand our world
13,56,00:02:29,{\an8}masked warrior
13,57,00:02:35,"first, we boil the sulfuric acid we got, and add a pinch of salt."
13,58,00:02:39,there's a weird glass sculpture with a stick in the middle.
13,59,00:02:43,how dare you make me make such a complicated thing?!
13,60,00:02:46,"i don't know what you're using it for, but you've gone and made me all excited!"
13,61,00:02:50,it's a water dripping machine.
13,62,00:02:53,are we catching the gas that's coming out of the
13,63,00:02:55,sulfuric acid and salt mixture as it drips?
13,64,00:02:57,{\an8}hydrochloric acid
13,65,00:02:58,now we've got hydrochloric acid.
13,66,00:03:00,hydrochloric acid?
13,67,00:03:02,it's a somewhat dangerous chemical.
13,68,00:03:04,"get it in your eyes, and you'll go blind."
13,69,00:03:06,"next, the sinters from the sulfuric acid spring,"
13,70,00:03:09,which people love taking home from hot springs.
13,71,00:03:12,"boil this stuff, throw it into the hydrochloric acid we just made, and..."
13,72,00:03:16,{\an8}chlorosulfuric acid
13,73,00:03:17,now we have chlorosulfuric acid.
13,74,00:03:19,chlorosulfuric acid?
13,75,00:03:21,this stuff is really dangerous.
13,76,00:03:23,"get it on your skin, and you'll turn into a skulking zombie."
13,77,00:03:29,good.
13,78,00:03:31,"man, it smells like a swimming pool."
13,79,00:03:33,"separate the salt water using electricity, and..."
13,80,00:03:36,{\an8}sodium hydroxide
13,81,00:03:37,we have sodium hydroxide.
13,82,00:03:40,sodium hydroxide?
13,83,00:03:42,this chemical is ultra dangerous.
13,84,00:03:44,the yakuza use it to melt corpses.
13,85,00:03:46,"ah, i see, i see."
13,86,00:03:50,"a drug that makes you blind, turns you into a zombie, and melts your corpse."
13,87,00:03:54,i see.
13,88,00:03:56,you're going to make ruri-nee drink that?
13,89,00:03:59,no one's drinking it!
13,90,00:04:00,we're using it to prepare the drug!
13,91,00:04:03,don't worry.
13,92,00:04:04,the rest of the chemicals are harmless.
13,93,00:04:06,let's go get some ammonia.
13,94,00:04:08,woo!
13,95,00:04:10,ammonia?
13,96,00:04:16,we have ammonia.
13,97,00:04:16,{\an8}urine
13,98,00:04:16,(ammonia)
13,99,00:04:18,and you're going to make ruri-nee drink that?
13,100,00:04:22,"she's not drinking it, damn it!"
13,101,00:04:24,we're using it to prepare the drug!

13,123,00:04:26,"all right, we're getting there."
13,124,00:04:29,we're more or less down to three items.
13,125,00:04:29,{\an8}alcohol
13,126,00:04:29,{\an8}vinegar
13,127,00:04:29,{\an8}sodiumbicarbonate

13,136,00:04:31,"acetic anhydride, sodium bicarbonate, and anilin."
13,137,00:04:35,it all sounds like some kind of spell.
13,138,00:04:37,we can't make any of it without alcohol.
13,139,00:04:40,"put another way, if we just get some alcohol..."
13,140,00:04:43,"we'll have the ultimate cure-all, sulfa drugs."
13,141,00:04:48,"let's start making alcohol, then!"
13,142,00:04:51,it's going to be a bit of a pain.
13,143,00:04:53,we can use all the help we can get.
13,144,00:04:55,alcohol?
13,145,00:04:56,what are you talking about?
13,146,00:04:58,"if you win the grand bout tomorrow,"
13,147,00:05:01,the villagers will give you more than you can ever finish.
13,148,00:05:05,"wait, the grand bout is tomorrow?"
13,149,00:05:08,the timing is too perfect.
13,150,00:05:14,yeah.
13,151,00:05:15,"if kinro or ginro wins, we'll have alcohol,"
13,152,00:05:19,and we can give ruri the cure-all drug!
13,153,00:05:21,yeah.
13,154,00:05:22,"we're going to win the grand bout, even if it kills us."
13,155,00:05:28,it's finally time.
13,156,00:05:30,"your husband, the new village chief, will be chosen tomorrow."
13,157,00:05:34,"isn't that right, ruri?"
13,158,00:05:36,yes.
13,159,00:05:38,turquoise!
13,160,00:05:39,are preparations for the grand bout proceeding well?
13,161,00:05:42,yes.
13,162,00:05:43,"well, yes..."
13,163,00:05:45,"the preparations are, at least."
13,164,00:05:47,that said...
13,165,00:05:49,why is kohaku competing again?!
13,166,00:05:52,you need to tell her she can't!
13,167,00:05:54,anyone over fourteen and not yet married can participate.
13,168,00:05:57,the sacred rules of the grand bout are immutable.
13,169,00:06:00,no one expected a girl to compete!
13,170,00:06:05,"well, let's let it be."
13,171,00:06:07,a man who can't even defeat a woman isn't fit
13,172,00:06:11,"to fill the seat of the village chief, anyway."
13,173,00:06:16,"chief, there's actually one more problem."
13,174,00:06:19,hm?
13,175,00:06:21,there's a new contestant.
13,176,00:06:24,you're participating in the grand bout?!
13,177,00:06:27,i signed him up!
13,178,00:06:29,"senku's over fourteen and unmarried, after all!"
13,179,00:06:33,"yeah, there's no rule that says you have to be a villager."
13,180,00:06:39,since when have senku and ginro been so close?
13,181,00:06:43,their skeevy sides brought them together.
13,182,00:06:47,"but, senku, you aren't a very capable fighter."
13,183,00:06:51,i don't plan on winning.
13,184,00:06:53,i just want to tire them out.
13,185,00:06:55,"plus, if we go up against each other..."
13,186,00:06:59,boop.
13,187,00:07:00,"oh, no, you got me!"
13,188,00:07:02,we move up without breaking a sweat!
13,189,00:07:04,"the more contestants on our side, the better! right?!"
13,190,00:07:08,y-you're rigging the game.
13,191,00:07:10,"you're way too underhanded, ginro."
13,192,00:07:13,"either way, even with worthy goals, rules are rules."
13,193,00:07:18,i'm not going to lose on purpose to rig the game.
13,194,00:07:21,"of course, of course!"
13,195,00:07:23,"you look like the best bet to win against magma anyway, kinro."
13,196,00:07:27,save your energy and make it to the top.
13,197,00:07:30,"you don't need to cheat, kinro."
13,198,00:07:34,"we're just going to be all like, ""mercy!"""
13,199,00:07:38,got a problem with that?
13,200,00:07:41,neither of you look very righteous.
13,201,00:07:46,kohaku! what about you?
13,202,00:07:48,are you fine with tarnishing the game by rigging it?
13,203,00:07:54,{\an8}anti
13,204,00:07:54,{\an8}pro
13,205,00:07:54,"well, i mean..."
13,206,00:07:54,{\an8}rigging
13,207,00:07:56,{\an8}anti
13,208,00:07:56,{\an8}pro
13,209,00:07:58,"if it improves ruri-nee's chances of surviving, even just a little..."
13,210,00:08:31,it's been nearly half a year since he arrived.
13,211,00:08:35,finally...
13,212,00:08:40,i'm setting foot in the village for the first time.
13,213,00:08:44,this is the first step.
13,214,00:08:53,is that the outsider who wants to enter the grand bout?
13,215,00:08:57,yes.
13,216,00:08:58,his name is senku.
13,217,00:09:01,senku?
13,218,00:09:03,did you say his name is senku?
13,219,00:09:07,"what, have you met him before or something, ruri?"
13,220,00:09:11,"no, i haven't."
13,221,00:09:14,"of course i haven't, but..."
13,222,00:09:17,i still know...
13,223,00:09:20,i still know senku.
13,224,00:09:24,hey!
13,225,00:09:26,for years...
13,226,00:09:28,"no, possibly even from long, long ago in the past."
13,227,00:09:35,"senku-san, right?"
13,228,00:09:38,"so you're the priestess, ruri."
13,229,00:09:41,"we finally meet, huh?"
13,230,00:09:44,there's something i must ask you.
13,231,00:09:49,"senku, what is your last name?"
13,232,00:09:56,last...
13,233,00:09:57,...name?
13,234,00:09:59,your last name is another name that attaches to—
13,235,00:10:01,"yeah, i know what it is."
13,236,00:10:03,there's no culture of having last names in this village.
13,237,00:10:06,how does this woman know?
13,238,00:10:08,could it be that you're ishi—
13,239,00:10:13,ruri-sama!
13,240,00:10:15,outsider!
13,241,00:10:17,stay away from the priestess!
13,242,00:10:18,don't make her walk!
13,243,00:10:20,carry her back immediately!
13,244,00:10:22,are you all right?
13,245,00:10:24,yes.
13,246,00:10:26,"i have a ton of questions, too."
13,247,00:10:29,"let's have a good, long interview once the grand bout is over with."
13,248,00:10:35,this is excellent.
13,249,00:10:36,i might not need to kill ruri.
13,250,00:10:40,it looks like she'll croak as soon as we get married.
13,251,00:10:50,"anyone but you, magma!"
13,252,00:10:54,"hey, that's not bad form for chrome."
13,253,00:10:58,chrome's been practicing poking that target non-stop.
13,254,00:11:04,i'm practicing hitting magma's weak spot.
13,255,00:11:07,his weak spot? you don't mean...
13,256,00:11:08,yep! his wee-wee!
13,257,00:11:11,i agree.
13,258,00:11:12,"if the goal is to wear him down, then it makes sense to go for his testicles."
13,259,00:11:17,kohaku-chan...
13,260,00:11:19,you're beyond tomboy or butch when it comes to fighting.
13,261,00:11:24,you're simply... insane.
13,262,00:11:27,"i don't have a chance of winning,"
13,263,00:11:29,but i'm going to chip away at magma as much as i can before
13,264,00:11:32,kinro or someone else goes up against him.
13,265,00:11:34,that's the best i can do.
13,266,00:11:37,that means the match-up is going to be crucial.
13,267,00:11:43,rig it! rig it!
13,268,00:11:46,make a match-up that'll let us rig it!
13,269,00:11:49,{\an8}rig it! rig it!
13,270,00:11:49,"yup, screw having a fair fight."
13,271,00:11:53,the kingdom of science fights with wits and genius.
13,272,00:11:53,{\an8}make a match-up that'll let us rig it!
13,273,00:11:56,let's game the grand bout to hell and back.
13,274,00:11:59,"we'll rig it so that kinro gets to the top unscathed,"
13,275,00:12:03,and pit him against an exhausted magma.
13,276,00:12:05,which means it's best for us if kinro and magma are in separate blocks.
13,277,00:12:09,although it'll be quickest if i can defeat magma in the first match.
13,278,00:12:14,right.
13,279,00:12:15,"if you win in the finals, it all gets reset."
13,280,00:12:18,"when it comes to drawing straws, all we can do is pray to god."
13,281,00:12:22,kohaku-chan and magma start off together.
13,282,00:12:24,kinro and magma never go against each other.
13,283,00:12:26,kohaku-chan and magma start off together.
13,284,00:12:26,{\an8}it sounds like a tongue twister.
13,285,00:12:28,kinro and magma never go against each other.
13,286,00:12:30,{\an8}kohaku-chan and magma start off together!
13,287,00:12:32,{\an8}kinro and magma never go against each other!
13,288,00:12:32,they're drawing up the tournament brackets.
13,289,00:12:33,{\an8}kohaku-chan and magma start off together.
13,290,00:12:35,{\an8}kinro and magma never go against each other!
13,291,00:12:36,kohaku-chan and magma start off together.
13,292,00:12:38,kinro and magma never go against each other!
13,293,00:12:39,kohaku-chan and magma start off together!
13,294,00:12:41,kinro and magma never go against each other!
13,295,00:12:45,the first round of the grand bout will be between...
13,296,00:12:53,kinro and magma!
13,297,00:13:02,this is bad.
13,298,00:13:04,this is really bad.
13,299,00:13:05,this is seriously bad!
13,300,00:13:07,it turned out the exact opposite of what i prayed for!
13,301,00:13:10,"damn it, how could we be so unlucky?"
13,302,00:13:13,what can you do?
13,303,00:13:16,a science user doesn't count on being lucky.
13,304,00:13:19,"you just do what you can, even if you're dealt the worst cards."
13,305,00:13:23,"a rigged grand bout is won by doping,"
13,306,00:13:26,with this kingdom special science power-up drink!
13,307,00:13:31,that's another mighty suspicious drink.
13,308,00:13:34,does it have some kind of crazy drug in it?
13,309,00:13:37,"sadly, it's perfectly safe."
13,310,00:13:39,"it's made from tea leaves, honey, and sweet flag."
13,311,00:13:43,"the caffeine's a stimulant, the sweet flag will keep you cool,"
13,312,00:13:47,and the honey will jack your blood sugar through the roof.
13,313,00:13:49,"in this stone world, that's nothing short of doping."
13,314,00:13:54,who said to drink all of it?!
13,315,00:13:57,we're all out?!
13,316,00:13:58,what do you want me to do?!
13,317,00:14:00,"if you lose to magma, i'm going to have to beat him!"
13,318,00:14:05,he ate the ingredients raw.
13,319,00:14:07,"dude, he finished all the sweet flag."
13,320,00:14:11,is that the grass that's growing all over the river?
13,321,00:14:14,i'll go pick some!
13,322,00:14:16,"i may not be competing, but i can still make myself useful!"
13,323,00:14:32,"but, hey, i just need you to make it to the final match, right?"
13,324,00:14:40,this is bad!
13,325,00:14:42,suika-chan fell in the river trying to pick herbs!
13,326,00:14:45,she's drowning!
13,327,00:14:48,"you're the quickest, kohaku-chan, so you'd better go help her before she dies!"
13,328,00:14:55,"you're ten billion percent lying, obviously."
13,329,00:15:01,i-i'm not lying.
13,330,00:15:03,i just happened to pass by her at the river when i saw her!
13,331,00:15:08,how do you know she was there to pick herbs
13,332,00:15:11,"if you just ""happened"" to see her at the river?"
13,333,00:15:14,come back in ten billion years if you want to have a brain battle
13,334,00:15:17,"with the science team, you blatant idiot."
13,335,00:15:22,"i know he's lying,"
13,336,00:15:24,"but if there's even the slightest chance that he's not,"
13,337,00:15:27,i'd be letting suika die.
13,338,00:15:29,"kohaku, you're our last stand against magma."
13,339,00:15:34,if you bail now...
13,340,00:15:35,but i'm the only one who can save her. i'm the fastest.
13,341,00:15:40,"i know he's lying, but i have to go to the river."
13,342,00:15:48,"you're a despicable man, mantle."
13,343,00:15:52,kohaku!
13,344,00:15:54,n-no way!
13,345,00:15:58,round one: kinro! magma!
13,346,00:16:00,forward!
13,347,00:16:02,"yeah, but kohaku went to save suika."
13,348,00:16:07,"if kohaku doesn't return in time for her match in round three, she'll be disqualified."
13,349,00:16:13,damn it!
13,350,00:16:15,"get back quick, kohaku!"
13,351,00:16:20,"good going, mantle."
13,352,00:16:21,yeah!
13,353,00:16:23,i had to make doubly sure.
13,354,00:16:25,"now that kohaku is gone, there's no one who can defeat me."
13,355,00:16:29,"i, magma-sama, will be the next village chief and ruri's husband."
13,356,00:16:34,kinro!
13,357,00:16:36,"if you surrender now, i'll make you my right-hand man."
13,358,00:16:41,i don't dislike strong men.
13,359,00:16:45,"lick my shoes in front of everyone, here and now!"
13,360,00:16:49,i'll take that as your pledge.
13,361,00:16:54,"magma, even if what you say is true, i would never surrender."
13,362,00:17:01,"even in the midst of this corrupt grand bout,"
13,363,00:17:04,i'm incapable of fighting except in earnest.
13,364,00:17:08,"not only that, but i'm not the same man i was before."
13,365,00:17:14,you've never won against me once!
13,366,00:17:17,what could possibly be different?
13,367,00:17:21,i...
13,368,00:17:23,"i have no choice but to win, for my friends!"
13,369,00:17:29,round one: magma versus kinro.
13,370,00:17:32,begin!
13,371,00:17:33,your filthy greed is nothing compared to what motivates me!
13,372,00:17:45,"kinro, when did you become so strong?"
13,373,00:17:50,"wow, he's evenly matched with magma."
13,374,00:17:53,he might have a chance!
13,375,00:17:55,"huh, he's doing ten billion percent better than i thought he would."
13,376,00:17:59,this is all thanks to our battle team's training.
13,377,00:18:02,"why are you getting so smug, ginro?"
13,378,00:18:08,if worse comes to worst...
13,379,00:18:10,"hey, mantle."
13,380,00:18:12,jasper's an insanely good referee.
13,381,00:18:14,he won't let you get away with that.
13,382,00:18:17,"you got this, kinro!"
13,383,00:18:17,not direct
13,384,00:18:17,direct attacksfrom outsiders
13,385,00:18:19,yeah!
13,386,00:18:23,"i was just, y'know..."
13,387,00:18:25,"click, click!"
13,388,00:18:26,clicking rocks together to cheer him on.
13,389,00:18:28,nuts.
13,390,00:18:36,"mantle tied it so tight, i can't get free."
13,391,00:18:46,"i have to get back to the others, quick!"
13,392,00:18:58,magma took a step back.
13,393,00:19:00,he always just goes by brute force.
13,394,00:19:04,magma's serious.
13,395,00:19:06,i've never seen him like that.
13,396,00:19:08,this is bad.
13,397,00:19:09,he's put distance between us.
13,398,00:19:25,kinro's straining his eyes.
13,399,00:19:30,suika! you're safe!
13,400,00:19:32,so he was lying about you drowning.
13,401,00:19:34,damn that mantle!
13,402,00:19:37,kinro probably has the fuzzy sickness in his eyes.
13,403,00:19:40,"i can tell because i have it, too."
13,404,00:19:45,what was that jab?
13,405,00:19:46,it didn't even come close.
13,406,00:19:59,"shit, that was a direct hit!"
13,407,00:20:00,kinro!
13,408,00:20:07,it's no use.
13,409,00:20:09,i can't move.
13,410,00:20:15,no...
13,411,00:20:16,not yet.
13,412,00:20:18,what i'm doing is important.
13,413,00:20:25,suika?
13,414,00:20:26,how did you get in here?
13,415,00:20:28,"i'm finally going to really, really put myself to use!"
13,416,00:20:35,"still not giving up, kinro?"
13,417,00:20:37,i like you even more.
13,418,00:20:39,i want you to be my henchman.
13,419,00:20:42,i'm going to use this hill to gain speed!
13,420,00:20:46,"now, lick my shoes!"
13,421,00:20:56,"it's the eyes of science, kinro!"
13,422,00:21:16,who the hell is that creep?!
13,423,00:21:19,what's the deal with that goofy mask?
13,424,00:21:25,my vision...
13,425,00:21:28,so this is science!
13,426,00:21:37,holy crap!
13,427,00:21:38,"he's dodging each one, just barely!"
13,428,00:21:40,wh-what's going on with you?
13,429,00:21:48,"i'm grateful for the science, suika, senku."
13,430,00:22:04,"let me teach you, magma..."
13,431,00:22:07,"had science helped me conquer my eyes,"
13,432,00:22:10,i would have surpassed your strength long ago.
13,433,00:22:45,maybe i don't know what to do　　
13,434,00:22:47,"hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　"
13,435,00:22:50,flying up to where the wind blew
13,436,00:22:53,in my hands awakens
13,437,00:22:55,the passion overflowing
13,438,00:22:57,just wandering through this world
13,439,00:22:59,your one shining pure
13,440,00:23:01,could never be pierced with a rusty knife
13,441,00:23:03,i'm burning like a fire gone wild
13,442,00:23:05,the moment an arrow shot through my heart
13,443,00:23:07,the noise plaguing me was released
13,444,00:23:10,everything was different from that moment on
13,445,00:23:12,"if i don't try, i'll never know"
13,446,00:23:15,why do flowers bloom?
13,447,00:23:20,your voice echoes
13,448,00:23:24,tell me why?
13,449,00:23:26,i just shouted to the sky　　
13,450,00:23:28,"but you are no no no longer here, that's right?"
13,451,00:23:30,the life we confirmed that day
13,452,00:23:35,you can call it a fleeting dream if you want
13,453,00:23:41,but i'll save you from a wounded today
13,454,00:23:58,{\an8}next time
13,455,00:24:01,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
14,1,00:00:08,"i'm grateful for the science, suika, senku."
14,2,00:00:23,"let me teach you, magma..."
14,3,00:00:27,"had science helped me conquer my eyes,"
14,4,00:00:30,i would have surpassed your strength long ago.
14,5,00:00:37,"damn, kinro!"
14,6,00:00:39,he's giving the magma a run for his money!
14,7,00:00:42,magma-sama!
14,8,00:00:44,"you're awesome, kinro!"
14,9,00:00:47,but it's not too convincing when you say it with that mask on.
14,10,00:00:51,yay!
14,11,00:00:53,magma's all worn out!
14,12,00:00:55,kinro's going to win it!
14,13,00:00:58,"we've already won, then!"
14,14,00:01:01,now we can give ruri the cure-all!
14,15,00:01:07,is that watermelon mask your sorcery?
14,16,00:01:10,isn't that against the rules?
14,17,00:01:13,you're right.
14,18,00:01:15,"even though it comes late, we'll have to confirm the rules."
14,19,00:01:19,i can't move anymore.
14,20,00:01:21,i can hardly even speak.
14,21,00:01:23,the match is over.
14,22,00:01:25,"ask jasper, the referee."
14,23,00:01:27,"if he agrees, i'll accept my loss."
14,24,00:01:33,"i can't hear what they're talking about, but magma's turned into a clean magma."
14,25,00:01:40,"referee, this mask was clearly thrown into the match by suika in order to help me."
14,26,00:01:46,"knowing that, i still wore it."
14,27,00:01:49,"if i've broken the rules, then i've lost."
14,28,00:01:51,the rules are the rules.
14,29,00:01:53,"damn it, you could just keep your mouth shut if it's going to hurt you."
14,30,00:01:57,that's kinro for you. he's so straight-laced.
14,31,00:02:03,you didn't throw it at him or anything.
14,32,00:02:05,the mask is just an article of clothing.
14,33,00:02:08,"therefore, it's not a—"
14,34,00:03:53,i knew you'd go and ask!
14,35,00:03:56,"you're as proper as hell, after all, kinro!"
14,36,00:04:03,winner: magma.
14,37,00:04:07,"damn, that dirty bastard!"
14,38,00:04:09,kinro!
14,39,00:04:11,kinro! kinro!
14,40,00:04:14,sorry.
14,41,00:04:15,thank goodness you're alive!
14,42,00:04:19,"well, whatever."
14,43,00:04:21,this is a team battle.
14,44,00:04:23,"as long as someone beats magma, we win."
14,45,00:04:26,that match should have dealt plenty of damage to him.
14,46,00:04:30,that's what matters the most.
14,47,00:04:33,"round two: chrome, mantle."
14,48,00:04:35,forward!
14,49,00:04:36,"oh, i'm up."
14,50,00:04:38,i'm more worried about the next match.
14,51,00:04:42,match 1
14,52,00:04:42,match 2
14,53,00:04:42,match 3
14,54,00:04:42,match 4
14,55,00:04:42,"{\an8}if kohaku isn't back by the end of match two, she'll be disqualified."
14,56,00:04:47,"{\an8}yeah, i know."
14,57,00:04:50,where's kohaku-chan?
14,58,00:04:51,where did kohaku-chan go?
14,59,00:04:54,she ran off earlier to save you.
14,60,00:04:57,what?!
14,61,00:04:58,i'm going to go find her!
14,62,00:05:02,sit still. you don't have your glasses.
14,63,00:05:07,it's too late either way.
14,64,00:05:10,all we can do is wait.
14,65,00:05:14,i have to buy as much time as i can.
14,66,00:05:26,after seeing kinro and magma fight for the top...
14,67,00:05:29,it's like watching two kids fight.
14,68,00:05:31,"hang in there, both of you!"
14,69,00:05:33,"chrome, huh?"
14,70,00:05:35,he's not going to be a match for me.
14,71,00:05:38,"even if he makes it to the top with me, he won't last a second."
14,72,00:05:48,kohaku!
14,73,00:05:49,mantle!
14,74,00:05:52,lose!
14,75,00:05:53,right now!
14,76,00:05:55,yeah!
14,77,00:05:56,"pay attention, man!"
14,78,00:05:58,mercy!
14,79,00:06:01,winner: chrome!
14,80,00:06:07,shit.
14,81,00:06:10,the third match...
14,82,00:06:15,"due to kohaku's absence, the winner is senku."
14,83,00:06:22,she didn't make it back in time!
14,84,00:06:25,senku!
14,85,00:06:28,kohaku-chan!
14,86,00:06:29,damn it!
14,87,00:06:30,you barely missed it!
14,88,00:06:33,i'm sorry!
14,89,00:06:35,mantle caught me!
14,90,00:06:36,thank goodness!
14,91,00:06:40,i'm so glad he was lying.
14,92,00:06:43,all that matters is that you didn't drown.
14,93,00:06:48,this is my fault.
14,94,00:06:50,i'm sorry.
14,95,00:06:53,"you lost because of me, kohaku-chan."
14,96,00:06:56,there's nothing we can do about that.
14,97,00:06:59,"besides, it isn't your fault in the slightest."
14,98,00:07:12,doesn't that basically settle it?
14,99,00:07:16,"the priestess's husband, the new chief, is..."
14,100,00:07:20,it's magma!
14,101,00:07:23,"be glad, ruri."
14,102,00:07:25,"from now on, you're my woman."
14,103,00:07:30,"now that we've lost our last stand in kohaku,"
14,104,00:07:33,the only real fighting chance we have left is...
14,105,00:07:37,ginro the guard. you're all we've got.
14,106,00:07:42,ginro the guard...
14,107,00:07:45,does ginro have any shot against magma?
14,108,00:07:48,"to be honest, it'll be tough."
14,109,00:07:52,"you said it yourself, senku..."
14,110,00:07:55,we're gaming the hell out of this grand bout.
14,111,00:07:58,the strongest isn't necessarily going to win.
14,112,00:08:02,haven't you been wondering what i've had in my mouth this whole time?
14,113,00:08:09,don't tell me...
14,114,00:08:10,isn't that the raw ingredients for senku's science drink?
14,115,00:08:13,you've kept that in your cheeks like a squirrel this whole time?
14,116,00:08:17,i've been saving it for just before my match.
14,117,00:08:20,"ginro, argo, forward."
14,118,00:08:24,i happen to know how powerful
14,119,00:08:27,senku's science power is from when we went to get sulfuric acid.
14,120,00:08:32,senku's special power-up drink...
14,121,00:08:36,i bet it's even more effective if it's raw!
14,122,00:08:38,raw?!
14,123,00:08:40,you're just going to end up with the runs!
14,124,00:08:42,shh. he's better off not knowing anything at this point.
14,125,00:08:50,here we go! here we go!
14,126,00:08:52,here we go!
14,127,00:08:55,{\an1}\h\hnote:\h\h\h\hginro's self-image
14,128,00:08:57,here we go... here we go...
14,129,00:09:00,that man sure is impressionable.
14,130,00:09:03,not that i didn't know that...
14,131,00:09:06,for better or worse.
14,132,00:09:08,there's so much gaming going on in this grand bout.
14,133,00:09:11,simpletons like him tend to break through in situations like these.
14,134,00:09:15,"match four, begin!"
14,135,00:09:19,this kid is nuts!
14,136,00:09:26,he's going straight at him.
14,137,00:09:29,ginro's on fire!
14,138,00:09:31,he's under the impression that he's gotten stronger just by eating the herbs?
14,139,00:09:35,he's never had caffeine before.he's probably completely wired.
14,140,00:09:39,and his gullibility makes him fearless.
14,141,00:09:42,not a thing wrong with that.
14,142,00:09:54,that does nothing to me.
14,143,00:09:57,what i have that you don't
14,144,00:09:57,{\an1}\h\hnote:\h\h\h\hginro's self-image
14,145,00:09:59,is the mind to trust in science!
14,146,00:10:03,"holy crap, ginro!"
14,147,00:10:04,"oh, damn!"
14,148,00:10:08,{\an1}reality
14,149,00:10:12,"holy crap, ginro..."
14,150,00:10:13,"oh, damn..."
14,151,00:10:19,damn it!
14,152,00:10:20,why won't you go down?
14,153,00:10:29,winner: ginro!
14,154,00:10:39,"where are you going, ginro?!"
14,155,00:10:41,he probably has the runs.
14,156,00:10:43,not surprising after how much he ate.
14,157,00:10:53,he's all beat up and withered out.
14,158,00:10:56,not good...
14,159,00:10:57,i don't think he'll be fighting any more.
14,160,00:11:06,i'm sure you know what the situation is.
14,161,00:11:09,"if we let magma make it to the final match, it's game over."
14,162,00:11:12,"the probability of ginro,"
14,163,00:11:15,"who's all beat up, or you defeating magma is zero."
14,164,00:11:19,so the only way to save ruri is for me to defeat magma.
14,165,00:11:25,"magma, chrome, forward!"
14,166,00:11:34,"if you can take down magma,"
14,167,00:11:37,"you'll be the new village chief and ruri's husband, chrome."
14,168,00:11:55,there's no way chrome can beat magma if they go head-to-head.
14,169,00:12:00,but this is a team battle.
14,170,00:12:02,all we can do is hope that kinro's done enough damage to him.
14,171,00:12:06,"chrome's been practicing hard against the target, too."
14,172,00:12:10,i'm sure the gods of battle are watching.
14,173,00:12:13,semi-final: magma versus chrome.
14,174,00:12:17,begin!
14,175,00:12:23,wh-what's going on? how's chrome doing against magma?
14,176,00:12:42,so awful...
14,177,00:12:44,we all knew how it was going to end.
14,178,00:12:46,he's toying with him on purpose.
14,179,00:12:52,you have to surrender!
14,180,00:12:54,chrome's going to die!
14,181,00:13:04,"oh, dear."
14,182,00:13:05,"this doesn't look too good, chrome-chan."
14,183,00:13:11,"chrome, i know you have no intention of throwing the match for ruri."
14,184,00:13:19,"i'm surprised you get it, magma..."
14,185,00:13:22,you meat-for-brains.
14,186,00:13:26,this just gets me even more excited.
14,187,00:13:28,"until ruri cries and begs for surrender in your place,"
14,188,00:13:31,i'll beat you into a pulp and make sure you never walk again.
14,189,00:13:35,chrome...
14,190,00:13:45,special attack: blinding!
14,191,00:13:50,"""special attack,"" my ass!"
14,192,00:13:52,you piece of shit!
14,193,00:13:58,that's right.
14,194,00:13:59,i never stood a chance against magma to begin with.
14,195,00:14:09,that's right.
14,196,00:14:10,i'm chrome.
14,197,00:14:13,science user chrome!
14,198,00:14:26,what is he doing with suika's mask?
14,199,00:14:31,"oh, look at that. it's the sorcery mask that i bashed up."
14,200,00:14:35,do you think you can scare me with that now?
14,201,00:14:42,clear sky.
14,202,00:14:48,i'm starting a fire with sunlight and a lens.
14,203,00:14:51,i have to bet everything on that one move.
14,204,00:14:56,he's got the wrong idea.
14,205,00:14:59,chrome's trying to use suika's lens to start a fire on magma's black clothes.
14,206,00:15:04,that's clearly his intention.
14,207,00:15:07,the magnifying glass i used
14,208,00:15:09,"to start a fire is convex, which means it focuses light."
14,209,00:15:12,"meanwhile, glasses are concave. they spread light."
14,210,00:15:15,what does that mean?
14,211,00:15:18,"suika's glasses aren't going to start a fire, ten billion percent."
14,212,00:15:25,i'm going to save ruri.
14,213,00:15:27,"i'm going to win and turn this village into a kingdom of science,"
14,214,00:15:31,with the lens senku made... and my tenacity!
14,215,00:15:40,i like it!
14,216,00:15:42,"show me what you've got, you lanky brat!"
14,217,00:15:48,"no, chrome!"
14,218,00:15:49,you can't start a fire with a concave lens!
14,219,00:15:51,"don't worry, senku-sensei."
14,220,00:15:55,i'm a bit of a science user myself!
14,221,00:15:59,"damn it, hold your arm completely still."
14,222,00:16:04,keep your nerves calm!
14,223,00:16:08,"chrome, don't tell me... no way..."
14,224,00:16:12,he was dripping water on the convex lens of suika's mask.
14,225,00:16:18,"he made a concave lens, literally out of sweat and tears."
14,226,00:16:26,"is that actually going to start a fire, though?"
14,227,00:16:30,"yeah, it's called a burning lens."
14,228,00:16:33,there's even been a case where a lens
14,229,00:16:35,made from a suction cup and air started a fire—
14,230,00:16:38,asagiri gen!
14,231,00:16:39,the smooth talker! why are you here?
14,232,00:16:42,long time.
14,233,00:16:44,"look, never mind what i've been up to."
14,234,00:16:48,shouldn't you be worried about chrome-chan?
14,235,00:16:50,i need the kingdom of science to win.
14,236,00:16:54,"i need that bottle of cola, y'know."
14,237,00:16:58,"you've been watching the whole time, haven't you?"
14,238,00:17:02,how many seconds does he need to start the fire?
14,239,00:17:04,that's the big question.
14,240,00:17:06,it turns out the math isn't that simple.
14,241,00:17:09,i'll figure it out right now.
14,242,00:17:15,the lens has a diameter of five centimeters.
14,243,00:17:17,the solar constant is 1362 watts per square meter...
14,244,00:17:21,"damn it, calculating the heat transfer rate mentally isn't easy."
14,245,00:17:25,2.6821...
14,246,00:17:28,rounded to 2.68.
14,247,00:17:30,"assuming a radiation rate of zero in calm winds,"
14,248,00:17:33,fur's condition for ignition is close to that of paper.
14,249,00:17:36,"with a specific heat of 1.3 kilojoules,"
14,250,00:17:38,"a density of 900 kilograms per cubic meter,"
14,251,00:17:41,an ignition point of 300 degrees celsius...
14,252,00:17:46,sixty seconds.
14,253,00:17:48,on the dot.
14,254,00:17:51,okay.
14,255,00:17:53,now it's up to the mentalist.
14,256,00:17:58,"come on, bring it."
14,257,00:18:00,"hurry it up, or i'll kill you."
14,258,00:18:05,magma-chan!
14,259,00:18:09,thanks for killing me the other day.
14,260,00:18:15,you!
14,261,00:18:16,you're the sorcerer from outside!
14,262,00:18:19,h-h-how are you alive?!
14,263,00:18:21,"with sorcery, of course."
14,264,00:18:31,i just put a curse on you so that your heart
14,265,00:18:35,will explode as soon as you so much as take a step.
14,266,00:18:39,his heart will explode?!
14,267,00:18:40,so he'll die in seconds?
14,268,00:18:41,this is obviously outside interference by sorcery!
14,269,00:18:44,this is cheating!
14,270,00:18:44,it would be if your heart exploded.
14,271,00:18:47,"but if it's a bluff, then it's just a taunt."
14,272,00:18:50,nothing wrong with that.
14,273,00:18:52,why don't you try moving?
14,274,00:18:55,see if you explode.
14,275,00:18:57,so dirty...
14,276,00:18:58,so dirty...
14,277,00:19:06,"chrome-chan, take him down while he can't move."
14,278,00:19:17,"o-oh, no!"
14,279,00:19:19,"i'm so terrified, i can't move anymore."
14,280,00:19:22,"wh-wh-what horrible acting, chrome!"
14,281,00:19:26,it's good enough.
14,282,00:19:27,gen made it convincing.
14,283,00:19:30,"please, i'm begging you!"
14,284,00:19:32,hurry!
14,285,00:19:33,this sorcery is seriously draining.
14,286,00:19:37,i can only hold him for a minute.
14,287,00:19:42,good thing you're a wimp.
14,288,00:19:44,all i have to do is wait for the sorcerer to run out of strength.
14,289,00:19:49,"not bad, mentalist."
14,290,00:19:52,kinro-chan's done quite a bit of damage to magma.
14,291,00:19:56,he kept whacking at chrome-chan with nothing left.
14,292,00:20:00,i get it.
14,293,00:20:01,{\an8}i want a break... i'm so tired...
14,294,00:20:01,you actually want to take a break.
14,295,00:20:03,and i've given you a beautiful excuse to do that.
14,296,00:20:06,you're best off waiting for the sorcery to wear off.
14,297,00:20:09,people will buy any cheap lie if it'll justify being lazy.
14,298,00:20:15,"you've already fallen for my magic, magma-chan."
14,299,00:20:20,what's the matter?
14,300,00:20:21,"go already, chrome!"
14,301,00:20:22,hurry up!
14,302,00:20:22,get him!
14,303,00:20:24,gen bought 60 seconds.
14,304,00:20:27,"it's up to you now, chrome."
14,305,00:20:30,sixty seconds is under ideal conditions.
14,306,00:20:32,even just the rippling of the water on the lens can throw off the calculation.
14,307,00:20:36,crap...
14,308,00:20:38,there's no way to keep the tip of the spear perfectly still.
14,309,00:20:41,calm your mind.
14,310,00:20:50,"thank you, chrome."
14,311,00:20:54,i'm going to save ruri.
14,312,00:21:02,"senku's science, gen's magic, my tenacity..."
14,313,00:21:09,"with our strengths combined, the light will set a fire."
14,314,00:21:18,pat it.
14,315,00:21:19,what is this?
14,316,00:21:23,it's a surface flash fire.
14,317,00:21:25,the flame spreads instantly across the surface of fluffy clothing.
14,318,00:21:31,"hey, magma, relax."
14,319,00:21:34,i have no intention of becoming a murderer.
14,320,00:21:37,i'll do you the kindness of helping you.
14,321,00:21:53,winner: chrome!
14,322,00:21:55,yeah!
14,323,00:21:56,magma's down!
14,324,00:22:00,which means the last contestants are...
14,325,00:22:02,"senku, chrome, and ginro-chan."
14,326,00:22:07,chrome!
14,327,00:22:09,they're all on our side!
14,328,00:22:13,yeah.
14,329,00:22:15,it's total victory for the kingdom of science!
14,330,00:23:51,{\an8}the culmination of two million years
14,331,00:23:58,{\an8}next time
14,332,00:23:58,{\an8}the culmination of two million years
14,333,00:24:00,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
15,1,00:00:08,i'll leave the village for now.
15,2,00:00:11,you wouldn't want to have to deal with an outsider
15,3,00:00:13,"who isn't even a contestant, right, kinro-chan the guard?"
15,4,00:00:17,we can talk about your end of our deal
15,5,00:00:19,"after you've captured the village, senku-chan."
15,6,00:00:24,sure.
15,7,00:00:28,chrome...
15,8,00:00:31,ruri-ch—
15,9,00:00:32,"priestess, you're going to have to marry the winner, huh?"
15,10,00:00:36,don't worry.
15,11,00:00:37,now it's just up to me or senku to give up the victory.
15,12,00:00:42,the winner is going to be chrome.
15,13,00:00:44,"i can tell, you know."
15,14,00:00:47,"you really wanted chrome to win, didn't you?"
15,15,00:00:53,"{\an8}ow, ow, ow!"
15,16,00:00:53,"good job figuring out the difference between convex and concave, chrome."
15,17,00:00:58,"no, as the priestess, i have no such thoughts."
15,18,00:01:03,i'm only a servant of the gods.
15,19,00:01:05,i will marry the winner of the grand bout.
15,20,00:01:09,really?
15,21,00:01:11,"huh, i always thought..."
15,22,00:01:13,wait a second... does that mean you don't really care who wins?!
15,23,00:01:16,huh?
15,24,00:01:18,well...
15,25,00:01:19,that's right.
15,26,00:01:20,"try to read between the lines a little, ginro."
15,27,00:01:24,what else is ruri-sama supposed to say?
15,28,00:01:28,{\an8}village chief
15,29,00:01:28,village chief...
15,30,00:01:30,ginro!
15,31,00:01:31,scumbag
15,32,00:01:35,match two of the semi-finals will now begin.
15,33,00:01:38,senku versus ginro.
15,34,00:01:40,"both contestants, forward."
15,35,00:01:44,"what the hell's gotten into you, ginro?!"
15,36,00:01:46,i mean...
15,37,00:01:48,ruri-chan said she'll marry anyone!
15,38,00:01:51,"so maybe i have a shot at being village chief, too!"
15,39,00:01:54,maybe it's finally my time to shine!
15,40,00:01:58,"g-ginro, you..."
15,41,00:02:00,he's way too scummy.
15,42,00:02:02,"if i become the chief, i'll get to have ramen every day!"
15,43,00:02:08,and a harem!
15,44,00:02:09,i'm going to turn it into a super awesome village!
15,45,00:02:18,i think he's...
15,46,00:02:20,ginro... anyone but you.
15,47,00:02:24,we can't let him become the village chief.
15,48,00:02:27,we have to take down that scum now!
15,49,00:02:30,but senku doesn't stand a chance.
15,50,00:02:37,senku...
15,51,00:02:40,"our weapon is science, is it not?"
15,52,00:02:51,i guess i don't have a choice.
15,53,00:02:54,"you're about to use some crazy sorcery, aren't you?"
15,54,00:02:57,no you don't!
15,55,00:03:07,"that man is smart. senku, was it?"
15,56,00:03:16,winner: senku!
15,57,00:03:17,ginro's down!
15,58,00:03:19,senku's going to the finals!
15,59,00:03:21,the whole village has come together!
15,60,00:03:24,yeah.
15,61,00:03:26,now we can turn the village into a kingdom of science...
15,62,00:03:30,and we can save... ruri...
15,63,00:03:40,"all right, it's the final now."
15,64,00:03:43,"now i just need to lose on purpose,"
15,65,00:03:46,"and chrome, you'll marry ruri and become the village chief."
15,66,00:03:51,happily ever afters all around!
15,67,00:03:54,get up and...
15,68,00:04:02,"um, he's conked out."
15,69,00:04:06,he must be mighty relieved to know that ruri-nee's going to be all right.
15,70,00:04:13,eh?
15,71,00:04:15,does that mean...
15,72,00:04:16,what happens now?
15,73,00:04:18,does that mean the final...
15,74,00:04:26,"the new village chief, the husband of the priestess..."
15,75,00:04:31,"is the winner of the grand bout, senku!"
15,76,00:04:37,{\an4}position of village chief and marriage partner acquired!!
15,77,00:06:12,{\an8}the culmination of two million years
15,78,00:06:17,s-so...
15,79,00:06:19,what now?
15,80,00:06:21,"well, this is a pain in the ass."
15,81,00:06:25,"so i just have to marry ruri, and the whole village is mine, right?"
15,82,00:06:32,"i'll do it, then."
15,83,00:06:34,senku's married!
15,84,00:06:36,"hold it, senku! where do you even come from?"
15,85,00:06:40,i won't allow an outsider to become the chief!
15,86,00:06:42,"well, well, if it isn't the former village chief."
15,87,00:06:46,i don't have a millimeter of interest in your lack of approval.
15,88,00:06:52,who are we supposed to side with?
15,89,00:06:54,"with kokuyo-sama, obviously!"
15,90,00:06:56,"what are you, mental?!"
15,91,00:06:58,"but he won in front of the gods, fair and square."
15,92,00:07:02,"and he's married to the priestess, too."
15,93,00:07:05,whatever. a win is a win.
15,94,00:07:07,wine! bring me wine!
15,95,00:07:10,that's too blunt!
15,96,00:07:11,you sound like one of those people!
15,97,00:07:20,this barrel's no good.
15,98,00:07:22,it's turned into vinegar.
15,99,00:07:24,"don't chuck it! we need that, too!"
15,100,00:07:29,ruri-nee!
15,101,00:07:30,ruri!
15,102,00:07:33,i'm fine.
15,103,00:07:34,she's definitely out of time.
15,104,00:07:39,"we just finished the bout, and i don't even have time to rest."
15,105,00:07:44,let's head back and finish the sulfa drug—
15,106,00:07:46,{\an8}hold it!
15,107,00:07:47,where do you think you're going? you're the guest of honor.
15,108,00:07:50,"come on, have a drink."
15,109,00:07:52,we're drinking through the night to celebrate. it's tradition.
15,110,00:07:56,"oh, really?"
15,111,00:08:01,"i'm divorcing, then."
15,112,00:08:04,senku got divorced!
15,113,00:08:08,i got a ton of alcohol and vinegar!
15,114,00:08:11,"let's haul ass, citizens of the kingdom of science!"
15,115,00:08:14,since when am i a citizen of the kingdom of science?
15,116,00:08:18,"sorry, ruri-nee! i'll explain later!"
15,117,00:08:23,that man is utterly insane.
15,118,00:08:27,"i'm a little confused, but it seems i've become the first divorced priestess ever."
15,119,00:08:35,"right, chrome?"
15,120,00:08:40,this is bullshit!
15,121,00:08:43,capture that man!
15,122,00:08:45,senku is not evil.
15,123,00:08:48,please let him explain for himself
15,124,00:08:51,"what the sorcerers—i mean, science users—"
15,125,00:08:54,have been risking their lives to do for the past half year.
15,126,00:08:58,what i've seen them do.
15,127,00:09:06,what's this?
15,128,00:09:07,the river water is making the bamboo spin around.
15,129,00:09:12,i nailed it on my first attempt.
15,130,00:09:14,"go, me!"
15,131,00:09:15,"you can fall in love with me if you want, girls."
15,132,00:09:17,not bad.
15,133,00:09:19,i usually botch my first few attempts at building anything.
15,134,00:09:22,"senku, you don't need to fall in love with me."
15,135,00:09:25,so what does this let us make?
15,136,00:09:28,that's the thing.
15,137,00:09:30,i have no idea.
15,138,00:09:33,you'll find out tomorrow.
15,139,00:09:35,i'll keep an eye on it for a while.
15,140,00:09:38,i'd cry if my child were to be destroyed by driftwood or something.
15,141,00:09:44,you!
15,142,00:09:45,are you going to leave a weak old man to stand guard by himself?!
15,143,00:09:48,stay and help. i'm sure you have nothing better to do!
15,144,00:09:52,"give me a break, grampa!"
15,145,00:09:56,"uh, sure. yes. i'll help you."
15,146,00:10:00,weak old man?!
15,147,00:10:13,wake up and smell the ammonia.
15,148,00:10:16,"get up and help out, science team!"
15,149,00:10:20,"now we just need to put it together, and we're done."
15,150,00:10:23,we're going to finish the ultimate cure-all sulfa drug by tomorrow.
15,151,00:10:27,tomorrow?!
15,152,00:10:30,{\an8}fun with making sulfa drugs
15,153,00:10:31,fun with making sulfa drugs.
15,154,00:10:33,step one.
15,155,00:10:35,"first, we're using a burnable rock called coal to..."
15,156,00:10:38,burnable rocks!
15,157,00:10:39,got it.
15,158,00:10:40,i have some in my shelter.
15,159,00:10:44,we used up all of it when we made iron.
15,160,00:10:48,damn it!
15,161,00:10:51,don't worry.
15,162,00:10:53,we can find plenty of the kind of cheap coal that you gathered
15,163,00:10:55,from any of the mountains around here.
15,164,00:10:58,"besides, it's not even the coal that we want."
15,165,00:11:02,it's the coal tar that's left after it's burned.
15,166,00:11:05,"first, wash it with hydrochloric acid,"
15,167,00:11:07,"then throw in ethyl acetate made from alcohol and vinegar, and we have anilin."
15,168,00:11:13,"hold it, hold it!"
15,169,00:11:14,i'm already totally lost!
15,170,00:11:17,that's step one?
15,171,00:11:18,how many of these complicated steps are we doing by tomorrow?
15,172,00:11:23,"oh, up to... step 25, maybe?"
15,173,00:11:27,holy...
15,174,00:12:02,"so what is this thing, anyway?"
15,175,00:12:05,can i look inside already?
15,176,00:12:15,is this...
15,177,00:12:17,{\an4}carbonated wateracquired!!
15,178,00:12:22,"can you make some, senku-chan?"
15,179,00:12:25,can you make a bottle of cola?
15,180,00:12:29,"yeah, i can."
15,181,00:12:31,even if no one else can.
15,182,00:12:33,"nah, there's no way he's that nice!"
15,183,00:12:38,"senku-chan, what's this fizzy water for?"
15,184,00:12:42,"oh, no!"
15,185,00:12:46,was there an explosion or something?
15,186,00:12:48,"this is pretty bad, huh?"
15,187,00:12:50,what have you done?
15,188,00:12:54,"we haven't done anything, really."
15,189,00:12:57,"we poured vinegar on some cooked shells,"
15,190,00:12:59,"extracted glacial acetic acid using sulfuric acid, turned it into ketene in an iron pipe,"
15,191,00:13:04,and put it back to make acetic anhydride.
15,192,00:13:06,h-huh. i see.
15,193,00:13:08,"so i tried to drip that acetic anhydride into the aniline,"
15,194,00:13:12,"but i poured on way too much, and kaboom."
15,195,00:13:15,so that's what this wreckage is from.
15,196,00:13:17,"mix the chlorosulfuric acid into the acetanilide we just made,"
15,197,00:13:21,and we get para-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride.
15,198,00:13:25,"throw some ammonia in there to make para-acetamidobenzenesulfonic acid,"
15,199,00:13:29,"cook it in hydrochloric acid, and you get that stuff."
15,200,00:13:32,"i'm impressed you can say that without stuttering, senku-chan."
15,201,00:13:36,"lastly, that carbonated water."
15,202,00:13:39,"oh, right, senku-chan."
15,203,00:13:40,"i'm not expecting anything, but..."
15,204,00:13:43,that's right. you know what carbonated water means.
15,205,00:13:46,carbonated water means...
15,206,00:13:49,we mix it with sodium hydroxide to make baking soda!
15,207,00:13:52,right.
15,208,00:13:53,of course. baking soda.
15,209,00:13:55,that's what i was thinking.
15,210,00:13:58,step 25.
15,211,00:14:00,"finally, we wash this stuff with baking soda, and then we wait."
15,212,00:14:06,it's been a long time.
15,213,00:14:18,half a year.

15,238,00:14:29,the cure-all sulfa drug.
15,239,00:14:32,it's done!
15,240,00:14:33,yeah!
15,241,00:14:38,finally...
15,242,00:14:40,"finally, ruri-nee..."
15,243,00:14:47,"don't start crying yet, idiot."
15,244,00:14:50,wait until she's actually better.
15,245,00:14:52,i'm not crying!
15,246,00:14:54,too bad.
15,247,00:14:55,"i can't go inside the village,"
15,248,00:14:57,so i won't be there to see ruri-chan take it.
15,249,00:15:02,have fun waiting at the lab by yourself.
15,250,00:15:05,"gen did lots and lots of work, too."
15,251,00:15:08,i feel sorry for him.
15,252,00:15:10,i guess this is just the way it is for bats like me.
15,253,00:15:22,"hey, i'm mecha senku!"
15,254,00:15:24,"mix together carbonated water, cilantro,"
15,255,00:15:27,"lime, and honey caramel, and you get cola."
15,256,00:15:31,try tossing some lime zest onto crushed cilantro.
15,257,00:15:34,you'll be shocked at how much it smells like cola!
15,258,00:16:08,"ruri, don't worry."
15,259,00:16:11,"that medicine is the powder of life, born from stone."
15,260,00:16:15,it's the cure-all of science.
15,261,00:16:17,it'll knock out your sickness for sure!
15,262,00:16:29,a mystery bug versus the culmination of two million years of human science...
15,263,00:16:37,this is exhilarating.
15,264,00:16:50,"all right, i finally get to see my patient."
15,265,00:16:54,time to make a diagnosis.
15,266,00:16:56,"say ""ee."""
15,267,00:17:06,it sounds like a goat bleating.
15,268,00:17:09,that's evidence that there's fluid in her lungs.
15,269,00:17:16,"what are you doing with that mouse, senku-chan?"
15,270,00:17:20,are we eating it?
15,271,00:17:22,i like how that's the first thing that comes to your mind.
15,272,00:17:25,"well, i don't eat rats, either."
15,273,00:17:29,i'm glad.
15,274,00:17:30,usually.
15,275,00:17:32,"usually, huh?"
15,276,00:17:35,they're a good source of protein.
15,277,00:17:38,"but unfortunately, we aren't eating it this time."
15,278,00:17:40,this is an autopsy.
15,279,00:17:44,red inflammation all over the lungs.
15,280,00:17:47,it's definitely a bacterial infection.
15,281,00:17:50,even the mice are catching it.
15,282,00:17:53,the question is what species of bacteria it is.
15,283,00:17:56,even a cure-all has its limits.
15,284,00:17:59,it's not ten billion percent guaranteed that it'll take down any bacteria.
15,285,00:18:04,if ruri has pulmonary tuberculosis...
15,286,00:18:06,if the enemy is a tuberculosis germ...
15,287,00:18:10,we don't stand a chance.
15,288,00:18:15,this is bad!
15,289,00:18:17,ruri-nee is...
15,290,00:18:19,ruri-nee is...
15,291,00:18:21,you don't need to get up.
15,292,00:18:23,stay on your side.
15,293,00:18:24,breathe slowly.
15,294,00:18:25,it's never been this bad before.
15,295,00:18:29,she may be in danger.
15,296,00:18:31,it started as soon as she had that suspicious white powder.
15,297,00:18:34,i told you not to trust sorcery medicine!
15,298,00:18:38,ruri!
15,299,00:18:39,ruri-nee!
15,300,00:18:48,senku...
15,301,00:18:52,"senku, you bastard!"
15,302,00:18:54,it's because of that drug!
15,303,00:18:56,father!
15,304,00:18:57,"if it weren't for that drug,"
15,305,00:18:58,ruri wouldn't have taken such a turn for the worse!
15,306,00:19:01,you might be right.
15,307,00:19:05,i knew it!
15,308,00:19:07,the bacteria is getting serious.
15,309,00:19:10,it's making allies by spreading
15,310,00:19:12,its toxic genes into the harmless bacteria all around it.
15,311,00:19:17,it's the pneumococcus bacteria's special move.
15,312,00:19:21,which means ruri's disease...
15,313,00:19:24,is pneumonia.
15,314,00:19:27,don't underestimate pneumonia.
15,315,00:19:29,it's a deadly disease that's killed hundreds of millions of people.
15,316,00:19:33,but sulfa drugs absolutely destroy pneumococcus bacteria.
15,317,00:19:40,we won!
15,318,00:19:41,human science has won!
15,319,00:19:44,"now that we know what it is, we have the upper hand."
15,320,00:19:47,we just need to throw more sulfa drug at her.
15,321,00:19:50,enough of this!
15,322,00:19:53,"father, this is nothing like the fraudulent sorcery that you know."
15,323,00:20:00,it's called science.
15,324,00:20:01,it's the culmination of human wisdom.
15,325,00:20:04,"i believe in science, and in senku."
15,326,00:20:11,"yeah, so do i!"
15,327,00:20:15,"i kind of do, too."
15,328,00:20:28,"sheesh, ruri."
15,329,00:20:29,i'm actually surprised she lived to eighteen.
15,330,00:20:33,"stay clean and keep warm, and the disease's progression will slow."
15,331,00:20:42,the hot spring water that kohaku hauled in every day ended up protecting ruri.
15,332,00:21:02,ruri...
15,333,00:21:04,ruri!
15,334,00:21:34,i don't remember how many years it's been...
15,335,00:21:37,since i've left the village or been able to run!
15,336,00:21:42,kohaku-chan's rambunctiousness must have run in the family all along.
15,337,00:21:50,"listen, all!"
15,338,00:21:52,"from this day forth, this man, senku, is the new chief of ishigami village!"
15,339,00:22:00,ishigami village?
15,340,00:22:04,"say, senku..."

16,6,00:00:30,your name is ishigami senku.
16,7,00:00:40,thanks. everything finally makes sense now.
16,8,00:00:44,"if everyone on the planet was petrified, who first made this village?"
16,9,00:00:50,why do you and kohaku clearly have foreign blood in you?
16,10,00:00:56,all the mysteries are solved.
16,11,00:01:01,"no, sorry... none of it makes sense to me."
16,12,00:01:05,yeah. how does senku happen to have the same name as the village?
16,13,00:01:10,"wait, ruri, you knew about senku?"
16,14,00:01:14,"i probably come up in your priestess mythology, don't i?"
16,15,00:01:20,yes.
16,16,00:01:21,mythology? you mean like momotaro with the gorilla and all that?
16,17,00:01:25,no wonder you people know about folk tales
16,18,00:01:28,and giant animals you would never have seen before.

16,30,00:04:04,"why do you keep following me, moon?"
16,31,00:04:16,"even if i juke it really hard, it follows me ten billion percent of the time."
16,32,00:04:22,"ever since he was very young, the boy, senku, showed interest in anything strange."
16,33,00:04:32,"maybe it has a crush on you, senku."
16,34,00:04:38,i don't need that crap right now.
16,35,00:04:41,i'm talking serious science.
16,36,00:04:43,what kind of preschooler are you?
16,37,00:04:47,the reason the moon looks like it's following you
16,38,00:04:50,is because it's super-duper far away.
16,39,00:04:52,"it's especially far away for me, since i failed the astronaut exam."
16,40,00:05:00,"i don't care about your wistful poetry right now, either."

16,53,00:05:34,"senku loves space as much as i do,"
16,54,00:05:36,but he thinks for himself and builds things for himself.

16,80,00:07:52,i figured.
16,81,00:07:54,though...
16,82,00:07:57,senku made it just for me.

16,84,00:08:06,"in the end, i managed to make it through the clothed swimming test,"
16,85,00:08:10,and i made it here to the interview.
16,86,00:08:13,"i'm going to become an astronaut and go into space, no matter what."

16,100,00:08:55,i'm going to bring home tons of scientific gifts for you.
16,101,00:08:59,{\an8}just wait!
16,102,00:09:00,"oh, shut up."
16,103,00:09:02,"{\an8}shoot, i gotta go. they're going to leave me behind."
16,104,00:09:03,"wait, is that your dad, ishigami-kun?"
16,105,00:09:05,let me see!
16,106,00:09:06,"{\an8}students, class is still in session."
16,107,00:09:27,the man who started the first generation of ishigami village...
16,108,00:09:32,was ishigami byakuya.
16,109,00:09:35,my father.
16,110,00:09:48,this is the soyuz.
16,111,00:09:50,commencing final preparations for docking with the international space station.
16,112,00:10:11,docking successful.
16,113,00:10:21,welcome to the international space station!
16,114,00:10:24,y-you've had a long journey.
16,115,00:10:28,pleasure to work with you.
16,116,00:10:29,sorry about my husband.
16,117,00:10:31,he's got a huge voice for someone with no balls.
16,118,00:10:35,i'm ishigami byakuya.
16,119,00:10:37,this is shamil.
16,120,00:10:39,nice to meet you.
16,121,00:10:42,why are these hallways so narrow?
16,122,00:10:44,i'm not the same as y'all.
16,123,00:10:48,i spent 50 million dollars to buy a seat in the soyuz.
16,124,00:10:51,"i'm a space tourist, i'll have you know."
16,125,00:10:53,"and this is how you greet me, diva lillian?"
16,126,00:11:00,don't tell me you don't know me!
16,127,00:11:02,"n-no, of course i do."
16,128,00:11:04,i even have your cds.
16,129,00:11:06,"then you get it, don't you?"
16,130,00:11:08,i do.
16,131,00:11:09,c-calm down.
16,132,00:11:10,do you really?
16,133,00:11:19,"why are you laughing, byakuya?"
16,134,00:11:22,i could have kept it up a while longer.
16,135,00:11:24,jeez!
16,136,00:11:25,"sorry, it was just so bad."
16,137,00:11:29,who even talks like that?
16,138,00:11:31,what a way to start our stay.
16,139,00:11:33,"stop laughing and make her stop, old man."
16,140,00:11:36,"i'm truly sorry, everyone."
16,141,00:11:39,i'm lillian weinberg.
16,142,00:11:41,i look forward to this coming week.
16,143,00:11:43,i'll try my best not to get in the way.
16,144,00:11:48,i thought the next week was going to be hell.
16,145,00:11:52,you got us good.
16,146,00:11:54,"if you were being serious, one more minute and i would have killed you."
16,147,00:11:59,i'm dalia. nice to meet you.
16,148,00:12:02,"that trembling giant over there is my husband, yakov."
16,149,00:12:07,i thought i was going to have a heart attack.
16,150,00:12:10,dalia and i were both doctors.
16,151,00:12:13,talk to us if you ever feel sick.
16,152,00:12:16,that's reassuring. thank you.
16,153,00:12:18,yakov's good to have around.
16,154,00:12:21,"it's his second time in space, after all."
16,155,00:12:24,"he's a bit of a wimp, but he's a veteran."
16,156,00:12:26,why are you acting like you're such a hotshot?
16,157,00:12:28,"knock it off, old man."
16,158,00:12:30,i'm kind of a big deal.
16,159,00:12:33,"you, too. don't get full of yourself."
16,160,00:12:35,the girl behind him is connie.
16,161,00:12:38,she was a staffer at nasa.
16,162,00:12:43,i-i'm...
16,163,00:12:46,"i'm a huge fan of yours, lillian-san!"
16,164,00:12:53,huh?
16,165,00:12:56,"that came out of nowhere, connie."
16,166,00:12:59,um...
16,167,00:13:01,that's all.
16,168,00:13:03,"come on, connie-chan."
16,169,00:13:05,get in there and demand an autograph.
16,170,00:13:08,go on!
16,171,00:13:10,may i... have your... autograph?
16,172,00:13:14,"sure, of course."
16,173,00:13:17,thank you!
16,174,00:13:19,did you see my assist?!
16,175,00:13:22,"well, i guess it's time to set the stage for a proper greeting for diva lillian,"
16,176,00:13:27,who spent 50 million to get here.
16,177,00:13:32,this'll be our background music for the rest of the trip.
16,178,00:13:35,agreed!
16,179,00:13:36,let's play it at least a hundred times a day.
16,180,00:13:38,"no! please, no! that's too embarrassing!"
16,181,00:13:41,"i'm sorry, i really am!"
16,182,00:15:09,that concludes my mini-concert in space.
16,183,00:15:13,i'm not masochistic enough to want to sing live
16,184,00:15:15,"in front of my astronaut buddies,"
16,185,00:15:17,so you'll have to let me off the hook now.
16,186,00:15:19,"see you, fans!"
16,187,00:15:24,"aren't y'all going to use the comms, shamil and byakuya?"
16,188,00:15:28,to contact your family or anything?
16,189,00:15:30,no need.
16,190,00:15:32,i don't have family.
16,191,00:15:33,"what about you, byakuya?"
16,192,00:15:35,"i have a son named senku,"
16,193,00:15:39,"but he's a bratty kid, like shamil here."
16,194,00:15:42,he has no interest in staying in touch.
16,195,00:15:45,he's probably focused on his research right about now.
16,196,00:15:54,the distribution of posts about stone swallow figures
16,197,00:15:57,being found around the world is proportional
16,198,00:16:00,to the distribution of swallow populations.
16,199,00:16:03,calculating statistical significance would be overkill.
16,200,00:16:06,which means these stone figures are real swallows that have been petrified.
16,201,00:16:12,swallows being petrified all over the world?
16,202,00:16:15,"that's so insane, it's hilarious."
16,203,00:16:18,this is exhilarating.
16,204,00:16:28,can't sleep?
16,205,00:16:30,"sorry, was i too loud?"
16,206,00:16:33,"so loud, my eardrums popped."
16,207,00:16:40,sorry about that.
16,208,00:16:42,"you really like singing, huh?"
16,209,00:16:48,i've been singing my whole life.
16,210,00:16:49,since you were a kid?
16,211,00:16:52,i picked up a record in the trash one day.
16,212,00:16:57,i've been listening to songs every day since.
16,213,00:17:02,"then, one day, my record player broke down."
16,214,00:17:07,"after that, i started singing for myself."
16,215,00:17:10,singing was just so much fun.
16,216,00:17:14,i want all kinds of people from all around the world to hear me sing.
16,217,00:17:20,"if it makes people appreciate the world and feel glad they were born,"
16,218,00:17:26,that would make me so happy.
16,219,00:17:28,just as i felt back then...
16,220,00:17:35,sorry about that.
16,221,00:17:37,this is seriously embarrassing.
16,222,00:17:42,hey...
16,223,00:17:45,"would you mind letting senku hear you sing someday, too?"
16,224,00:17:53,of course.
16,225,00:17:57,hey!
16,226,00:17:58,i'm miso soup!
16,227,00:18:00,help me!
16,228,00:18:01,i don't want to get eaten!
16,229,00:18:03,"whew, i'm flying!"
16,230,00:18:04,zero gravity!
16,231,00:18:05,i'm free!
16,232,00:18:11,"oh, no, you don't!"
16,233,00:18:12,what are you doing?
16,234,00:18:16,"want to try some japanese, shamil?"
16,235,00:18:20,this nutrient jelly is enough for me.
16,236,00:18:23,for every meal?!
16,237,00:18:25,d-don't you get tired of it?
16,238,00:18:31,here.
16,239,00:18:35,what's that? noodles?
16,240,00:18:37,it's ramen that i had custom-made.
16,241,00:18:39,it's the same taste you can get at the popular spot my son senku and i frequented.
16,242,00:18:44,"i don't deny that you have good taste, but you're pampering us."
16,243,00:18:49,the space agency people are here to work.
16,244,00:18:53,humans don't need to have fun to survive.
16,245,00:18:56,"come on, just try it."
16,246,00:18:58,it'll shock you.
16,247,00:19:15,see?
16,248,00:19:16,isn't it scary good?
16,249,00:19:17,really? can i try some?
16,250,00:19:21,no...
16,251,00:19:23,look.
16,252,00:19:24,outside the window.
16,253,00:19:27,at earth.
16,254,00:19:38,senku!
16,255,00:20:12,why?!
16,256,00:20:13,i can't get in touch with either nasa or roscosmos!
16,257,00:20:16,is it broken?
16,258,00:20:17,"no, no one's responding."
16,259,00:20:19,"n-no one's responding over amateur radio, either."
16,260,00:20:22,that light...
16,261,00:20:24,something must have happened on the surface.
16,262,00:20:25,something terrible.
16,263,00:20:28,l-like a nuclear war?
16,264,00:20:31,don't even talk like that!
16,265,00:20:35,yes!
16,266,00:20:36,the internet works.
16,267,00:20:38,is anyone tweeting about the situation?
16,268,00:20:45,no good.
16,269,00:20:46,everyone around the world stopped posting at the same time.
16,270,00:20:49,i know! the live cameras!
16,271,00:20:56,there!
16,272,00:20:59,what the hell is this?
16,273,00:21:01,statues?
16,274,00:21:04,is this even possible?
16,275,00:21:17,"oh, god..."
16,276,00:21:25,we shouldn't do anything rash.
16,277,00:21:26,let's wait here.
16,278,00:21:28,there are seven billion humans on the planet.
16,279,00:21:31,let's wait for the survivors to contact us.
16,280,00:21:33,they'll help us!
16,281,00:21:35,wait for how long?
16,282,00:21:37,a month?
16,283,00:21:38,two months?
16,284,00:21:39,"with humanity in this state,"
16,285,00:21:41,we don't have any hope of a rescue out here in space.
16,286,00:21:50,let's go back to earth.
16,287,00:21:54,"what are you talking about, byakuya?!"
16,288,00:21:56,"i told you, there are seven billion people!"
16,289,00:21:59,someone will come help us!
16,290,00:22:00,"no, yakov."
16,291,00:22:04,we're the last six humans.
16,292,00:22:09,wait for help?
16,293,00:22:11,you're wrong.
16,294,00:22:14,we're going to help them.
16,295,00:22:17,all seven billion humans.
16,296,00:23:57,{\an8}a hundred nights and a thousand skies
16,297,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
16,298,00:23:58,{\an8}a hundred nights and a thousand skies
16,299,00:24:01,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
17,1,00:00:10,look.
17,2,00:00:11,outside the window.
17,3,00:00:14,at earth.
17,4,00:00:40,it's so dark.
17,5,00:00:41,i'm scared.
17,6,00:00:41,i can't move.
17,7,00:00:42,i don't feel anything.
17,8,00:00:43,"if i'm aware of that, my head must be ten billion percent fully functional."
17,9,00:00:51,not bad.
17,10,00:00:53,"now, think."
17,11,00:00:55,for example...
17,12,00:00:56,there should be a delay between average times of the last posts by area
17,13,00:01:00,on sites like twitter and instagram.
17,14,00:01:03,"find those and calculate backwards,"
17,15,00:01:05,and we can learn where the mysterious light originated.
17,16,00:01:09,it definitely started in south america.
17,17,00:01:11,the petrification beam spread radially from there.
17,18,00:01:15,i would never have thought to figure it out that way.
17,19,00:01:18,"i'd love to brag, but i can't take the credit."
17,20,00:01:21,"my son, senku, uses that sort of method a lot."
17,21,00:01:25,"now that we know that, it's time to head out."
17,22,00:01:28,"hang in there, senku."
17,23,00:01:30,i'm going to save you along with all seven billion humans.
17,24,00:03:05,{\an8}a hundred nights and a thousand skies
17,25,00:03:12,are you really going back to the surface?
17,26,00:03:15,you might be petrified the moment you land.
17,27,00:03:17,"if you're going, then at least go somewhere opposite the source."
17,28,00:03:20,"like japan, on the opposite side of the globe from south america."
17,29,00:03:22,"if the petrification beam is like a radiation beam,"
17,30,00:03:25,you need to stay as far away as you can.
17,31,00:03:26,"well, someone's gotta be a human test subject."
17,32,00:03:30,"this was my idea, so i should really go by myself, but..."
17,33,00:03:34,then we won't have enough fuel for the return trip in the soyuz.
17,34,00:03:37,"they seat three each, and we only have two."
17,35,00:03:39,we need three of us to take the plunge.
17,36,00:03:42,"sorry, but i guess i'll need two more to come with me."
17,37,00:03:45,therefore...
17,38,00:03:50,shamil! you...
17,39,00:03:53,there won't be a ground crew to help you.
17,40,00:03:55,it'll be an unprecedented landing.
17,41,00:03:57,you could even be petrified while you're maneuvering.
17,42,00:04:00,"you have a son, don't you, old man?"
17,43,00:04:03,"if someone's going, it ought to be someone without a family."
17,44,00:04:06,like me.
17,45,00:04:16,eight... nine...
17,46,00:04:19,"216,000 seconds."
17,47,00:04:21,roughly sixty hours since i became immobilized.
17,48,00:04:37,i have great news and terrible news.
17,49,00:04:41,"the great news is that we've landed, and we aren't petrified."
17,50,00:04:46,the terrible news is that we missed the target by a great distance
17,51,00:04:49,and landed in the water upside-down.
17,52,00:04:52,"if we open the hatch, we'll take in water and sink."
17,53,00:04:55,don't worry.
17,54,00:04:57,they lasted for nine hours when they crash-landed on water before.
17,55,00:05:01,yeah.
17,56,00:05:03,but that's the end of our lives.
17,57,00:05:07,"five, six, seven..."
17,58,00:05:11,count the insane numbers to keep track of the date.
17,59,00:05:14,i have to know the seasons in the outside world for when i can revive.
17,60,00:05:19,that's all i can do right now.
17,61,00:05:22,"it may be a worst-case scenario, but i have to do what i can."
17,62,00:05:27,we have to go down there and find a boat to help them.
17,63,00:05:31,and where's the key to start the boat?
17,64,00:05:33,how many thousands of statues do we need to pickpocket before we find it?
17,65,00:05:36,even the closest continent—
17,66,00:05:37,we'll go help them from the nearest island.
17,67,00:05:40,i don't care if it's uninhabited.
17,68,00:05:42,"if we can't find a boat, we'll make a raft."
17,69,00:05:44,do you really think we can land perfectly on an island?!
17,70,00:05:47,we could be off by as much as ten kilometers!
17,71,00:05:49,ten kilometers is nothing.
17,72,00:05:51,"i'll swim the whole way,"
17,73,00:05:53,"fully clothed, if i have to."
17,74,00:06:03,let's calm our breathing.
17,75,00:06:06,we have to conserve oxygen.
17,76,00:06:09,"limit conversation, too."
17,77,00:06:16,{\an8}n-na na na na na na na na
17,78,00:06:20,{\an8}you can feel the music in the air
17,79,00:06:23,why are you singing?!
17,80,00:06:23,{\an8}n-na na na na na na na na
17,81,00:06:24,i just said to calm your breathing!
17,82,00:06:29,sorry. but i don't think we'll need our onboard oxygen anymore.
17,83,00:06:50,sorry it took me over ten hours.
17,84,00:06:56,"you're not young anymore, old man."
17,85,00:07:01,don't push it.
17,86,00:07:03,you're way too much of a risk-taker.
17,87,00:07:14,they're back!
17,88,00:07:16,everyone's safe!
17,89,00:07:20,that boat was abandoned on this island furthest away
17,90,00:07:24,from the petrification beam.
17,91,00:07:27,which means there might be survivors on this island.
17,92,00:07:45,no...
17,93,00:07:56,"oh, shoot."
17,94,00:07:58,why don't we start gathering firewood?
17,95,00:08:01,yeah.
17,96,00:08:17,bingo!
17,97,00:08:19,the soyuz survival kit!
17,98,00:08:22,"here we go, the ultimate toolkit."
17,99,00:08:25,it looks awesome.
17,100,00:08:26,we've been trained really well for shipwrecks.
17,101,00:08:30,"all right, let's start with dinner."
17,102,00:08:33,"oh, i'll go find food, then."
17,103,00:08:37,there were farms and such by that man we saw earlier.
17,104,00:08:39,that sounds good.
17,105,00:08:41,"you got this, connie-chan."
17,106,00:08:43,okay.
17,107,00:08:47,"i'll go, too, then."
17,108,00:09:04,— 3 years later —
17,109,00:09:15,"congratulations, connie-chan, shamil!you're married now!"
17,110,00:09:19,congratulations!
17,111,00:09:22,you look good together!
17,112,00:09:24,"i appreciate the gesture, but we don't need a fun ritual."
17,113,00:09:29,"with the world in the state it's in, i'm grateful just to be alive."
17,114,00:09:33,"oh, come on."
17,115,00:09:34,"we have to have fun, especially because of the situation we're in."
17,116,00:09:38,there's hardly even any entertainment.
17,117,00:09:39,sure there is.
17,118,00:09:41,music!
17,119,00:09:43,i'll sing for the occasion.
17,120,00:09:46,what an opportunity!
17,121,00:09:48,diva lillian!
17,122,00:09:51,how far we've come
17,123,00:09:54,how much we've changed
17,124,00:09:56,a thousand nights and a million tears
17,125,00:10:01,now i can say that i've conquered my fear
17,126,00:10:09,"if i could go back, what would i tell you"
17,127,00:10:15,wish you'd listen to the truth
17,128,00:10:18,till then i'll be patiently waiting right here
17,129,00:10:43,sorry.
17,130,00:10:45,i just feel so defeated.
17,131,00:10:49,all the music that so many geniusesspent thousands of years creating...
17,132,00:10:53,"mozart, the beatles..."
17,133,00:10:55,when i think that it's all going to go away...
17,134,00:10:58,it's not going away.
17,135,00:11:01,we'll undo the petrification someday.
17,136,00:11:03,{\an8}promises are kept deep in the heart
17,137,00:11:04,humanity isn't over.
17,138,00:11:06,"at the very least, i'm certain that senku is still alive."
17,139,00:11:06,{\an8}bells are ringing so loud
17,140,00:11:12,{\an8}our spirits will never die
17,141,00:11:12,yeah... i'm sure he is.
17,142,00:11:15,{\an8}as long as there is something worth fighting for
17,143,00:11:16,"he's your son, after all."
17,144,00:11:17,"well, we aren't blood relatives, but he's my son."
17,145,00:11:21,he's ten billion times more of a hotshot than i am.
17,146,00:11:24,{\an8}we won't give up
17,147,00:11:25,"he'd be like, ""giving up is the least logical course of action."""
17,148,00:11:26,{\an8}even if the sky is falling down
17,149,00:11:29,"so he wouldn't die, even if he was petrified."
17,150,00:11:30,{\an8}even if the stars crash and burn the ground
17,151,00:11:33,"even if our generation doesn't make it, he'll succeed."
17,152,00:11:35,{\an8}we'll believe our voice will reach the universe
17,153,00:11:39,he'll save all seven billion people.
17,154,00:11:42,{\an8}we won't give up till the end
17,155,00:11:46,{\an8}we won't give up till we smile again
17,156,00:11:47,"someday,"
17,157,00:11:50,"when senku is revived, he's going to need friends."
17,158,00:11:50,{\an8}cuz we're alive
17,159,00:11:53,{\an8}cuz we made a promise to the world
17,160,00:11:55,we're going to pass along the baton.
17,161,00:11:59,thousands of years into the future.
17,162,00:12:00,{\an8}to the world
17,163,00:12:20,it's such a weird story thati have no idea what it means.
17,164,00:12:25,yeah. all of humanity turned to stone thousands of years ago.
17,165,00:12:31,you know those stone statues we see all over the place?
17,166,00:12:34,those are all humans.
17,167,00:12:36,"six people, including senku's dad, survived because they were above the sky."
17,168,00:12:42,"everyone in ishigami village is a descendant of theirs,"
17,169,00:12:44,thousands of years later.
17,170,00:12:47,does that mean we're all related to senku?
17,171,00:12:54,byakuya and i aren't blood relatives.
17,172,00:12:56,so only legally.
17,173,00:12:58,"besides, we're hundreds of generations apart."
17,174,00:13:01,you can't call us relatives.
17,175,00:13:03,hey!
17,176,00:13:05,what are you doing up there? this is your day!
17,177,00:13:08,it's a celebration!
17,178,00:13:10,we have a new village chief!
17,179,00:13:12,you two just want an excuse to drink.
17,180,00:13:15,shall we all go to the feast together?
17,181,00:13:22,"drink up, sorcery user!"
17,182,00:13:25,i'm a science user—
17,183,00:13:27,dude!
17,184,00:13:37,"please, chief."
17,185,00:13:38,i'm not the chief anymore.
17,186,00:13:41,my apologies.
17,187,00:13:42,"to think ruri-sama is a divorcée, though..."
17,188,00:13:47,it hasn't been this lively in a while.
17,189,00:13:50,everyone's smiling. this is fun.
17,190,00:13:53,yeah! i'm having fu—
17,191,00:13:56,we have to guard the bridge.
17,192,00:14:00,no fair!
17,193,00:14:02,"no way, i'm an outsider."
17,194,00:14:05,who gives a damn?
17,195,00:14:07,come drink with us!
17,196,00:14:11,huh? where's the chief?
17,197,00:14:21,the story ends with a message from byakuya-sama.
17,198,00:14:26,i thought you should be the only one to hear it.
17,199,00:14:31,i figured it'd be something like that.
17,200,00:14:49,"if we go to the main islands,we can find antibiotics."
17,201,00:14:52,it's our turn to take a risk.
17,202,00:14:56,"if we don't come home, take care of the kids."
17,203,00:15:19,let's go back home.
17,204,00:15:40,it was only pneumonia.
17,205,00:15:42,damn it!
17,206,00:15:45,it was only pneumonia!
17,207,00:15:56,"you look unusually glum, old man."
17,208,00:16:02,you said it yourself.
17,209,00:16:04,"we have to have fun, especially in this situation."
17,210,00:16:09,you're right.
17,211,00:16:16,humans don't need to have fun to survive.
17,212,00:16:20,i had fun.
17,213,00:16:24,we managed to survive because humanity had already made it to space.
17,214,00:16:31,"i know this is only after the fact,"
17,215,00:16:33,"but i never thought i'd have a wife and kids, either."
17,216,00:16:38,i had so much fun since the day we went to space together.
17,217,00:16:49,there's something i haven't had a chance to tell you.
17,218,00:16:55,that day humanity was petrified...
17,219,00:16:59,you forced me to have some ramen.
17,220,00:17:03,that ramen i had in space...
17,221,00:17:06,it was so good.
17,222,00:17:10,it was almost hilarious.
17,223,00:17:13,yeah.
17,224,00:17:15,humanity will make it back to the point where we'll be eating ramen in space.
17,225,00:17:21,i'm sure of it.
17,226,00:17:54,what's that? a story?
17,227,00:17:56,pearls of wisdom to help our descendants live on.
17,228,00:17:59,i thought i'd make them into stories so it'd be fun.
17,229,00:18:01,that sure is something a former teacher would think of.
17,230,00:18:05,"it's hard writing stories in english, though."
17,231,00:18:08,you can write them in japanese.
17,232,00:18:10,"i want to learn your mother tongue, too."
17,233,00:18:15,the hundred tales.
17,234,00:18:17,most important is how to manage food and how to avoid dangers.
17,235,00:18:21,large beasts and such.
17,236,00:18:23,we'll want a story about minerals.
17,237,00:18:26,someone might come along who takes an interest in rocks and collects them.
17,238,00:18:35,"the hundred tales, story number one..."
17,239,00:18:38,"i want them to head to japan, where senku waits."
17,240,00:18:45,"just as byakuya-sama had hoped,"
17,241,00:18:48,someone took an interest in rocks because of his stories.
17,242,00:18:51,and that's chrome.
17,243,00:18:53,yes.
17,244,00:18:56,the old man wasn't totally useless after all.
17,245,00:19:09,this is the village cemetery.
17,246,00:19:12,it's said that these are the graves of byakuya-sama and the other founders.
17,247,00:19:19,"they bit the dust 3,700 years ago."
17,248,00:19:22,"even if the story was legit, you won't find a single bone."
17,249,00:19:27,"and the last of the hundred tales, the hundredth story..."
17,250,00:19:32,...is a message from me.
17,251,00:19:35,"hey, senku."
17,252,00:19:37,"if you're listening to this story,"
17,253,00:19:40,"it means you've broken through the petrification,"
17,254,00:19:42,maybe thousands of years from now.
17,255,00:19:44,i'm doing great.
17,256,00:19:46,"i mean, i'm already dead by now, but... you know."
17,257,00:19:50,"i promised you a science gift, and that gift is the friends"
17,258,00:19:54,that the hundred tales will connect you with.
17,259,00:19:59,"the world was pretty fun, even after the collapse."
17,260,00:20:08,"with your science and your friends' help,"
17,261,00:20:13,i'm certain you can build a world that's even more fun.
17,262,00:20:22,you won't lose.
17,263,00:20:24,"you'll rebuild civilization, from scratch if you have to,"
17,264,00:20:27,and you'll save all of humanity.
17,265,00:20:30,"senku, i know you can do it."
17,266,00:20:43,i'm going to look around before i go back.
17,267,00:20:48,okay.
17,268,00:20:49,i'll be back at the village.
17,269,00:20:51,yeah.
17,270,00:20:57,i see.
17,271,00:20:59,"that was thousands of years ago, huh?"
17,272,00:21:02,"that was when i was still alone in the darkness,"
17,273,00:21:05,counting hundreds of millions of seconds.
17,274,00:21:11,that takes me back.
17,275,00:21:14,man...
17,276,00:21:16,that really takes me back.
17,277,00:21:34,i would have been screwed without your science gift.
17,278,00:21:37,"i'm happy to receive it, thousands of years later."
17,279,00:21:44,"no, i only drink cola."
17,280,00:21:47,cola?
17,281,00:21:48,i wouldn't be able to talk business if i got drunk.
17,282,00:21:51,"now that the whole village is in one place, i have a message to deliver."
17,283,00:21:54,"yeah, let's hear it, mentalist."
17,284,00:21:59,what happened in the tsukasa empire?
17,285,00:22:04,they're coming.
17,286,00:22:06,tsukasa-chan and his army.
17,287,00:22:11,it's finally time to show them the power of the kingdom of science.
17,288,00:22:17,this is exhilarating.
17,289,00:23:58,{\an8}next time
17,290,00:24:00,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
18,1,00:00:08,"no, i only drink cola."
18,2,00:00:11,cola?
18,3,00:00:12,i wouldn't be able to talk business if i got drunk.
18,4,00:00:15,"now that the whole village is in one place, i have a message to deliver."
18,5,00:00:18,"yeah, let's hear it, mentalist."
18,6,00:00:23,what happened in the tsukasa empire?
18,7,00:00:28,they're coming.
18,8,00:00:30,tsukasa-chan and his army.
18,9,00:00:36,"gen, you haven't actually seen senku's body."
18,10,00:00:41,"if he is alive out there,"
18,11,00:00:43,he'll surely discover the village and build a kingdom of science.
18,12,00:00:48,that would be the worst conceivable scenario.
18,13,00:00:54,"as soon as we have an army, we'll take the village by force."
18,14,00:00:59,more ridiculously strong men like him are coming?
18,15,00:01:04,"probably, yeah."
18,16,00:01:06,he's been reviving a ton of people.
18,17,00:01:11,we've come to an all-out war between the kingdom of science
18,18,00:01:15,and the kingdom of might.
18,19,00:01:18,this is exhilarating.
18,20,00:01:28,a party sounds like so much fun.
18,21,00:01:31,"i'd be there, too, if it weren't for a certain stubborn someone"
18,22,00:01:34,"who has nothing to say but ""rules are rules""..."
18,23,00:01:37,guarding the village is our duty.
18,24,00:01:40,"if they were to attack the village, they'd do it now, during the celebration."
18,25,00:01:46,"ginro, go back and alert the others."
18,26,00:01:51,about what?
18,27,00:02:01,"if they reach the living quarterswhere the children are, it's over."
18,28,00:02:06,"ginro, if i'm killed, cut down the bridge with me on it."
18,29,00:02:25,huh...
18,30,00:02:27,"he immediately realized he was outnumbered,"
18,31,00:02:30,and now he's luring us onto the bridge to fight one-on-one.
18,32,00:02:34,i like it.
18,33,00:02:35,he's very proper.
18,34,00:04:22,he's trying to run away!
18,35,00:04:24,"are you scared, caveman?"
18,36,00:04:36,i never would have thought your brain was so melted
18,37,00:04:39,that you'd expect to win against a spear on a narrow bridge.
18,38,00:04:42,the caveman is a lot more proper than you are.
18,39,00:04:46,he broke my nose!
18,40,00:04:48,"we're sorry, hyoga-san."
18,41,00:05:02,"huh? you have bad eyesight, don't you?"
18,42,00:05:07,"tsukasa-chan isn't the only one who's really bad news, though."
18,43,00:05:14,"if he or tsukasa-chan were to show up, frankly, you'd all have to run."
18,44,00:05:22,that man who was revived the other day is hyoga-chan.
18,45,00:05:27,"i told them i'd go in as a spy and lead the way, and left first."
18,46,00:05:33,but i could only buy so much time—
18,47,00:05:34,guys!
18,48,00:05:36,bad news!
18,49,00:05:38,the enemy is here!
18,50,00:05:45,this is impossible!
18,51,00:05:49,how is he able to throw his spear so fast?
18,52,00:05:55,they're already attacking us?
18,53,00:05:57,this is seriously bad!
18,54,00:05:58,the guy kinro-chan's fighting is hyoga!
18,55,00:06:13,kinro!
18,56,00:06:18,"stop, kohaku."
18,57,00:06:19,now!
18,58,00:06:21,cut down the bridge!
18,59,00:06:23,ginro!
18,60,00:06:27,"let me go, father!"
18,61,00:06:28,fool! you don't stand a chance against a spear on a bridge!
18,62,00:06:31,but kinro—
18,63,00:06:33,kohaku!
18,64,00:06:33,think about the children!
18,65,00:06:36,we have to cut it down!
18,66,00:06:38,"come on, hurry!"
18,67,00:06:53,they're right.
18,68,00:06:54,i have to do it.
18,69,00:06:56,i have to cut the bridge down to save the village.
18,70,00:07:01,that's it.
18,71,00:07:03,i can no longer be saved.
18,72,00:07:20,i can't do it.
18,73,00:07:23,how could i?
18,74,00:07:25,kinro would die if i did that!
18,75,00:07:30,"i can't do it, nii-chan!"
18,76,00:07:38,what are you doing with the iron tube?
18,77,00:07:43,who would have thought we'd be using the last of our gunpowder for a bluff?
18,78,00:07:54,are you serious?
18,79,00:07:58,"you're the strongest one in the village, right, magma-chan?"
18,80,00:08:02,yeah.
18,81,00:08:03,throw this rock at the enemy...
18,82,00:08:06,as hard as you can.
18,83,00:08:08,how am i supposed to hit them with that?
18,84,00:08:11,"why should i listen to you, anyway?"
18,85,00:08:12,you don't have to hit them.
18,86,00:08:15,"you want to take the title of village chief away from senku-chan, don't you?"
18,87,00:08:19,the whole village might go away.
18,88,00:08:22,you need to cooperate for now.
18,89,00:08:31,magma-chan!
18,90,00:08:40,"hyoga-chan, everyone! retreat!"
18,91,00:08:45,this village already has guns!
18,92,00:08:48,run!
18,93,00:08:49,damn it!
18,94,00:08:50,"you'd better run, too, hyoga-chan!"
18,95,00:08:57,which means you must be...
18,96,00:09:02,you guys waited too long. we've already finished building
18,97,00:09:06,the kingdom of science.
18,98,00:09:08,oh? i'm sure tsukasa-kun will be very pleased.
18,99,00:09:13,"yeah, tell tsukasa that ishigami senku is still alive."
18,100,00:09:18,tell him we've built about ten billion rifles with the power of science.
18,101,00:09:29,kinro's dead!
18,102,00:09:33,i'm still alive.
18,103,00:09:34,"don't go killing me off, ginro."
18,104,00:09:40,antipyretic analgesic acetanilide.
18,105,00:09:44,we made some while we were making the sulfa drug.
18,106,00:09:47,and now...
18,107,00:09:48,here.
18,108,00:09:49,"rub it on your wounds, and you should be all better by tomorrow."
18,109,00:09:54,tomorrow?
18,110,00:09:55,you're just pulling that out of your ass!
18,111,00:10:02,i'm all better.
18,112,00:10:03,holy crap!
18,113,00:10:05,"wait, no."
18,114,00:10:06,he's just acting tough!
18,115,00:10:07,he's still nowhere near okay!
18,116,00:10:09,i'm the guard.
18,117,00:10:10,i can't be sleeping forever.
18,118,00:10:13,there's no telling when those bastards will be back in full force.
18,119,00:10:16,how are you so strait-laced?!
18,120,00:10:18,of course he's strait-laced.
18,121,00:10:20,he's kinro.
18,122,00:10:21,"not necessarily, though."
18,123,00:10:24,we can predict when they'll be coming.
18,124,00:10:29,i can't go back to tsukasa after being so utterly humiliated!
18,125,00:10:34,damn it!
18,126,00:10:35,those twigs would be nothing if they didn't have guns!
18,127,00:10:38,then the best time to attack
18,128,00:10:39,"would be during a storm, when they can't use matchlock guns."
18,129,00:10:43,they'll wait around for a storm because they're afraid
18,130,00:10:46,of guns we don't even have.
18,131,00:10:49,gen will talk them into it.
18,132,00:10:52,"ah, i see."
18,133,00:10:54,so we just wait for a storm.
18,134,00:10:56,"setting aside such brain-dead opinions about how humiliated we are,"
18,135,00:11:00,going on the day of a storm
18,136,00:11:02,seems so obvious that we may be marching to our deaths.
18,137,00:11:07,"now that we know senku-kun is alive, the tables have turned 180 degrees."
18,138,00:11:12,let's be proper about this.
18,139,00:11:13,we ought to return immediately and build a large army with tsukasa-kun.
18,140,00:11:19,"are you scared, hyoga?"
18,141,00:11:21,you're a hopeless little twig without your weapon...
18,142,00:11:24,your kudayari or whatever you call it!
18,143,00:11:30,kudayari?
18,144,00:11:31,this thing with the bamboo tube?
18,145,00:11:34,i've never seen one before.
18,146,00:11:36,i wouldn't touch it if i were you.
18,147,00:11:38,unless you want me to kill you.
18,148,00:11:41,"sorry, hyoga-chan!"
18,149,00:11:42,the storm!
18,150,00:11:44,we attack as soon as the storm hits!
18,151,00:11:46,yeah!
18,152,00:11:47,all right!
18,153,00:11:48,"if they're going to be so aggressive,"
18,154,00:11:51,letting them fight senku-kun might not be a bad idea.
18,155,00:11:55,"we may be able to win,"
18,156,00:11:57,"but if they fight the kingdom of science and lose, we'll have seen their hand."
18,157,00:12:04,"they're not worth much, even as pawns."
18,158,00:12:15,"oh, damn! he looks badass!"
18,159,00:12:17,he looks good.
18,160,00:12:18,that cures his fuzzy sickness?
18,161,00:12:21,"i'm impressed by this sorcery—i mean, science."
18,162,00:12:24,i'm glad kinro doesn't have the fuzzy sickness anymore.
18,163,00:12:28,"you had new ones made for you, too, huh?"
18,164,00:12:31,this just feels more right for me!
18,165,00:12:35,that's not all the scientific battle prep we're doing.
18,166,00:12:38,the man in the black maskis quite formidable.
18,167,00:12:42,do you have some way to use science to fight him?
18,168,00:12:44,yeah. you and the battle team are going to be in tears when you see it.
18,169,00:12:49,time to show off your skills.
18,170,00:12:58,say what? that sounds awesome!
18,171,00:13:05,his body gets thick when he gets excited about making things.
18,172,00:13:08,let's hurry up and get started.
18,173,00:13:10,don't waste time!
18,174,00:13:12,we're racing against the storm.
18,175,00:13:15,yeah!
18,176,00:13:17,"all hands on deck, ishigami village!"
18,177,00:13:38,it's a powerful wind from the mountains.
18,178,00:13:44,it's a storm!
18,179,00:13:45,it only took three days to arrive.
18,180,00:13:47,the heavens are on my side!
18,181,00:13:50,now they can't use their guns.
18,182,00:14:37,j-japanese katanas!
18,183,00:14:40,these are the most powerful weapons in the stone world.
18,184,00:14:47,the blades of science.
18,185,00:14:50,i like it.
18,186,00:14:51,the kingdom of science is very proper.
18,187,00:14:55,"they might be a little ugly, though."
18,188,00:15:00,i can see perfectly.
18,189,00:15:02,this is the power of glasses!
18,190,00:15:04,"i have magma, kohaku-chan, and kinro by my side."
18,191,00:15:06,we can do this!
18,192,00:15:09,it cuts so well.
18,193,00:15:11,this is the power of science...
18,194,00:15:13,damn it. how do these exist in the stone world?
18,195,00:15:16,we're in trouble. their weapons are far stronger.
18,196,00:15:26,"get it up to 1,200 degrees with pine coals."
18,197,00:15:29,"when the flame turns purple, it's ready."
18,198,00:15:33,smack the hell out of the metal to get rid of impurities.
18,199,00:15:37,"and then fold it, fire it up again, and hit it some more."
18,200,00:15:43,"it's called ""orikaeshi tanren."""
18,201,00:15:46,we're powering up the ironby doing it over and over.
18,202,00:15:49,"you do this brutal, slow work at least ten times."
18,203,00:15:54,"oh, damn!"
18,204,00:15:55,"at least, that's how you'd make a real japanese katana..."
18,205,00:15:58,but twice is enough.
18,206,00:15:59,it is?!
18,207,00:16:02,we have modern science to thank for that.
18,208,00:16:05,we looked at the crystalline structure of metal
18,209,00:16:07,and realized it was basically done after two folds.
18,210,00:16:10,we aren't katana artisans.
18,211,00:16:13,we're going for speed.
18,212,00:16:14,"any step science lets us skip, we skip."
18,213,00:16:17,what's more important is the quenching.
18,214,00:16:20,"the blade forms into martensite when it's well-done,"
18,215,00:16:24,and the parts with plenty of clay paste become semi-ferrite.
18,216,00:16:27,"i don't know much about the science, but the point is..."
18,217,00:16:32,"the blade is made strong for cutting,"
18,218,00:16:35,and the back is made flexible for parrying.
18,219,00:16:37,is that right?
18,220,00:16:39,that's so cool!
18,221,00:16:42,you can count on a craftsman to learn quickly.
18,222,00:16:46,it's the difference between the two sides
18,223,00:16:49,that makes the japanese katana the most powerful blade in the world.
18,224,00:16:54,{\an4}katana acquired!!
18,225,00:17:00,our weapons are broken!
18,226,00:17:02,"it's not just your weapons.your minds are broken, too."
18,227,00:17:08,though i'm sure that's what senku-kun's trying to accomplish
18,228,00:17:12,by showing off his japanese katanas.
18,229,00:17:19,but your katanas are no match for my kudayari and my kanryu-style spearmanship!
18,230,00:17:26,it's round...
18,231,00:17:27,a moon?
18,232,00:17:28,what is that?
18,233,00:17:43,this spearman hyoga is in a different league.
18,234,00:17:50,"magma, kohaku-chan, and kinro-chan are the strongest ones in the village."
18,235,00:17:53,"take down those three and you win, hyoga-chan."
18,236,00:17:57,"thank you for the intel, gen-kun."
18,237,00:18:00,not that i couldn't have seen it for myself.
18,238,00:18:02,what the hell is that gen bastard doing?
18,239,00:18:04,is he an enemy?
18,240,00:18:06,did he betray them to betray us?
18,241,00:18:08,that bat bastard!
18,242,00:18:09,no.
18,243,00:18:10,he's secretly telling us that it'll take all three of us to take him down.
18,244,00:18:15,hand it over!
18,245,00:18:16,that's not yours!
18,246,00:18:18,"then let's go, kinro, magma!"
18,247,00:18:22,he's not even listening!
18,248,00:18:23,that's magma for you!
18,249,00:18:26,"whatever. we'll fight together, whether he likes it or not."
18,250,00:18:29,"we'll use magma's huge body as a decoy while you send me up, kinro."
18,251,00:18:32,"all right, got it."
18,252,00:18:35,s-send her up?!
18,253,00:18:50,he can still react to an attack from above?
18,254,00:18:54,if i can just deliver the first blow...
18,255,00:18:59,he's twisting his wrist to spin the tip around.
18,256,00:19:03,i can't see where the tip is!
18,257,00:19:15,the spear tip...
18,258,00:19:16,...suddenly broke off.
18,259,00:19:22,"a cut that's too precise to have been made with stone tools,"
18,260,00:19:26,and too well-hidden to see...
18,261,00:19:27,"with enough force, it tears apart."
18,262,00:19:31,"it's almost like magic, isn't it?"
18,263,00:19:34,seriously?!
18,264,00:19:35,who would have done such a thing?
18,265,00:19:39,kudayari?
18,266,00:19:41,this thing with the bamboo tube?
18,267,00:19:46,"gen-kun, i like you."
18,268,00:19:49,you're very proper...
18,269,00:19:51,as a dirty bat betrayer.
18,270,00:19:55,"what are you talking about, hyoga-chan?!"
18,271,00:19:58,why would i do such a thing?
18,272,00:20:04,"well, damn."
18,273,00:20:07,you had me figured out already.
18,274,00:20:08,that's my hyoga-chan.
18,275,00:20:17,"suika, deliver something to gen for me."
18,276,00:20:21,but gen's with the enemy right now.
18,277,00:20:24,we don't even know where he is.
18,278,00:20:26,a mentalist would have left signs to follow.
18,279,00:20:29,signs that only we'd recognize.
18,280,00:20:32,"work hard, detective suika."
18,281,00:20:51,i've only seen these flowers in the sun before.
18,282,00:20:55,why are they here in the shade?
18,283,00:21:09,"the forest is my playground, so i can tell!"
18,284,00:21:12,these are the signs that gen left for us!
18,285,00:21:40,do you know this flower?
18,286,00:21:42,"it's not supposed to bloom in the shade,"
18,287,00:21:44,so it's perfect to use as a secret signal.
18,288,00:21:47,it's called black nightshade.
18,289,00:21:48,i used it on the stage a lot. it's one of my favorites.
18,290,00:21:53,"in floriography, it means ""liar."""
18,291,00:21:59,"you're a pretty good swordsman, mentalist."
18,292,00:22:03,"it cuts exhilaratingly well, doesn't it?"
18,293,00:22:08,this is the blade of science.
18,294,00:23:56,{\an8}to modernity
18,295,00:23:58,{\an8}next episode
18,296,00:23:58,{\an8}to modernity
18,297,00:24:01,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
19,1,00:00:21,that's the guy tsukasa-san's been looking for all this time.
19,2,00:00:25,what? really?
19,3,00:00:30,who is this guy?
19,4,00:00:41,"hello, hyoga."
19,5,00:00:43,"you're 3,700 years in the future."
19,6,00:00:47,"this is a new world, where your skills can truly shine."
19,7,00:00:56,"i was wondering what kind of badass he was going to revive,"
19,8,00:00:59,but this guy's just a little twig!
19,9,00:01:03,is he really gonna be of any use?
19,10,00:01:08,you'll understand if you fight him.
19,11,00:01:11,care for a spar?
19,12,00:01:13,you sure? he might end up dead.
19,13,00:01:16,i feel kinda bad for the guy.
19,14,00:01:18,"he just woke up, after all!"
19,15,00:01:23,i don't mind.
19,16,00:01:27,"if i can use my favored weapon, i'll take on ten men by myself."
19,17,00:01:37,too late to back out now!
19,18,00:01:48,"well, that's certainly impressive."
19,19,00:01:53,i apologize. there weren't enough men for a warm-up spar after your rest.
19,20,00:01:59,it's not a question of numbers.
19,21,00:02:03,the only proper fighter here...
19,22,00:02:05,"in other words, the one i wouldn't want to fight,"
19,23,00:02:10,"is you, the strongest primate, shishio tsukasa-kun."
19,24,00:02:15,let me show you around our new world.
19,25,00:02:43,"you see, hyoga, nature is generous with its bounty."
19,26,00:02:47,we lack nothing.
19,27,00:02:50,"the world was like that for ages, long before people began to live on it."
19,28,00:02:56,it didn't belong to anyone.
19,29,00:03:00,"but the moment you and i were born, the old world told us:"
19,30,00:03:07,"""this world, down to its last square centimeter,"
19,31,00:03:12,"belongs to some rich old fool."""
19,32,00:03:17,that's right.
19,33,00:03:19,"i worked myself ragged day in and day out,"
19,34,00:03:22,then had to give up more than half of it for rent and whatnot.
19,35,00:03:25,"that's more or less slavery, looking back on it now."
19,36,00:03:28,"the privileged exploit the impoverished young, feeding on them."
19,37,00:03:33,"that was the old world, where people fought and stole from each other."
19,38,00:03:36,i'm a lot happier now.
19,39,00:03:41,although part of that comes from being a fan
19,40,00:03:44,"of the strongest primate, tsuka-san."
19,41,00:03:47,"hey, we caught a big one!"
19,42,00:03:52,"we're back, tsukasa-san."
19,43,00:03:54,excellent work.
19,44,00:03:57,"{\an8}we managed to find a boar this time. brought it down, too!"
19,45,00:03:58,"well, tsukasa-chan was already charismatic in the old world..."
19,46,00:04:01,{\an8}thank you both.
19,47,00:04:04,"take someone strong, handsome, and soft-spoken,"
19,48,00:04:07,"give him a half-decent argument,"
19,49,00:04:10,and it'll be tough to talk anyone into turning on him.
19,50,00:04:20,"now, hyoga, would you have called the society of 3,700 years ago a utopia?"
19,51,00:04:27,not at all.
19,52,00:04:29,"suppose the privileged class of the old world was revived now,"
19,53,00:04:34,and they obtained the weapons of science that make killing so easy.
19,54,00:04:38,what do you think would happen?
19,55,00:04:40,i imagine they'd try to use those weapons to recreate
19,56,00:04:44,the pyramid of wealth they stood upon.
19,57,00:04:46,no one who has sampled that sweet nectar could ever abandon it.
19,58,00:04:51,"regardless, this world has been reset"
19,59,00:04:54,and is in no condition to support seven billion lives.
19,60,00:04:59,there must be a culling.
19,61,00:05:02,"the two most dangerous fighters, and they're in total agreement..."
19,62,00:05:08,then a new world must be built by the young.
19,63,00:05:13,there's no need to recreate the old one.
19,64,00:05:20,"there was a... i'm not sure i can call him a friend,"
19,65,00:05:25,"but a man named senku who had a superhuman grasp of science,"
19,66,00:05:28,and he sought to revive the old world.
19,67,00:05:33,so...
19,68,00:05:35,i killed him with my own hands.
19,69,00:05:38,"with no senku, there will be no science."
19,70,00:05:42,the corrupt human race will be purified and march on to a new world.
19,71,00:05:50,to accomplish that...
19,72,00:05:53,i'll stain my hands as much as necessary.
19,73,00:07:45,{\an8}to modernity
19,74,00:07:50,th-they even cut through hyoga-san's spear!
19,75,00:07:53,"damn it, it's useless! run for it!"
19,76,00:07:55,we did it!
19,77,00:07:58,"remarkable athleticism, coordinated teamwork,"
19,78,00:08:02,and dirty betrayal...
19,79,00:08:06,and the scientific knowledge to create guns and japanese katanas.
19,80,00:08:10,you people truly seem to know the proper way to do things.
19,81,00:08:16,it would have been even more proper if you had realized
19,82,00:08:20,that all of this was a distraction.
19,83,00:08:27,so that's what they were after...
19,84,00:08:33,crap! a fire!
19,85,00:08:36,run!
19,86,00:08:37,head for the bridge! hurry!
19,87,00:08:43,jasper! turquoise!
19,88,00:08:45,i don't need protection! save the children!
19,89,00:08:48,right!
19,90,00:08:59,the bridge...
19,91,00:09:02,who is that?
19,92,00:09:06,a hindrance.
19,93,00:09:07,get everyone to safety!
19,94,00:09:15,another one?
19,95,00:09:16,"say hello to my right hand, homura-kun."
19,96,00:09:19,"she can properly handle herself, unlike these men and their melted brains."
19,97,00:09:44,what are those moves?
19,98,00:09:53,this is not good.
19,99,00:09:55,"once a fire starts,"
19,100,00:09:56,"the wind from the mountainwill become a wind of death,"
19,101,00:09:59,carrying the flames far and wide!
19,102,00:10:01,everyone!
19,103,00:10:03,this way!
19,104,00:10:06,forget about the houses! do you people want to die?!
19,105,00:10:10,get out of here right now!
19,106,00:10:16,"we can't go that way, either! the bridge is burned out!"
19,107,00:10:18,we have to get to the science shed!
19,108,00:10:46,"nice work, homura."
19,109,00:10:47,i couldn't leave after being humiliated like that.
19,110,00:10:50,your humiliation means nothing.
19,111,00:10:53,we set those fires to force the villagers out into the open.
19,112,00:10:56,"that should be obvious, even to your melted brain."
19,113,00:11:01,we're dealing with people so naive that theywouldn't even abandon a village guard.
19,114,00:11:07,why does that matter?
19,115,00:11:09,i get it!
19,116,00:11:10,we grab one of the kids that we smoked out
19,117,00:11:12,and use 'em as a hostage! then we win!
19,118,00:11:14,of course! that makes sense!
19,119,00:11:18,there's no guarantee they'll attack head-on.
19,120,00:11:20,keep your senses spread out in every direction!
19,121,00:11:24,can we really protect a group this big?!
19,122,00:11:26,shelter the children in the science shed! it's our only hope!
19,123,00:11:29,o-okay!
19,124,00:11:41,get the water!
19,125,00:11:42,"this way, hurry!"
19,126,00:11:44,"start dousing, quick!"
19,127,00:11:44,hurry up!
19,128,00:11:45,it's burning up!
19,129,00:11:47,"all those minerals chrome spent years gathering,"
19,130,00:11:50,and the lab we spent months building!
19,131,00:11:52,"if it gets wrecked, we'll..."
19,132,00:11:55,i'm going to protect the kingdom of science!
19,133,00:12:02,look!
19,134,00:12:02,some dumb kid who didn't get away in time!
19,135,00:12:08,after her! she'll be our hostage!
19,136,00:12:13,so devoted that she'd act as a diversion to help the others?
19,137,00:12:17,i certainly appreciate her naïveté.
19,138,00:12:20,"we only need one captive to win,"
19,139,00:12:23,and this will be far easier than attacking the home base of those soldiers of science.
19,140,00:12:31,gotta hide and run in turns to lure them away from the kingdom of science.
19,141,00:12:35,"i'll run upwind, toward the mountain,"
19,142,00:12:38,so they can't smoke me out with more fire!
19,143,00:12:43,there she is! that way!
19,144,00:12:47,suika did what?!
19,145,00:12:48,i-i tried to stop her!
19,146,00:12:50,she was heading up the mountainto the hot springs!
19,147,00:12:53,"hey, this is the hot spring area that i draw hot water from all the time."
19,148,00:12:57,it gets dangerous up ahead.
19,149,00:12:59,"the poison gases that form here,"
19,150,00:13:02,"hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, are heavier than air."
19,151,00:13:06,there's a strong wind coming down the mountain...
19,152,00:13:10,something about this wind...
19,153,00:13:14,it's not exactly giving me a good feeling.
19,154,00:13:18,give it up already!
19,155,00:13:20,let's break one of her legs when we catch her!
19,156,00:13:35,this wind... death.
19,157,00:13:42,suika!
19,158,00:13:44,get up into a tree!
19,159,00:13:50,wh-what just happened?!
19,160,00:13:53,you don't have to worry.
19,161,00:13:55,the poison gas will settle to the bottom.
19,162,00:13:58,did she say... poison gas?!
19,163,00:14:12,mother nature is neither friend nor foe.
19,164,00:14:17,she's as impartial as they come.
19,165,00:14:19,poison gas?!
19,166,00:14:21,"did you make this happen, you twig?!"
19,167,00:14:26,"yeah, you bet i did."
19,168,00:14:29,that's what you get for pulling a dumbass move like a suicide attack
19,169,00:14:33,"on our kingdom of science, with its modern weaponry."
19,170,00:14:36,"now, let's head back, suika."
19,171,00:14:40,"if you breathe nice and slow, you'll be fine."
19,172,00:14:42,o-okay!
19,173,00:14:46,you guys head back and suckle on mommy tsukasa's teat...
19,174,00:14:50,"after you wait ten billion seconds for the gas to clear out, that is."
19,175,00:15:00,is he screwing with us?! i'm not gonna wait ten billion seconds!
19,176,00:15:03,how could he even make poison gas in this stone world in the first place?!
19,177,00:15:09,good point. let's deal with this properly.
19,178,00:15:12,we'll need to make sure the gas is gone before we move.
19,179,00:15:15,how fortunate that you lot
19,180,00:15:17,"will finally do a job properly, despite your melted brains."
19,181,00:15:38,"well, look at that. they properly died."
19,182,00:15:42,"so those gas masks, at least, were real."
19,183,00:15:47,it seems that senku-kun
19,184,00:15:49,and his allies have a variety of metals and chemicals under their control.
19,185,00:15:54,the kingdom of science certainly does loom large.
19,186,00:15:58,we can always rebuild the lost buildings!
19,187,00:16:01,we've repelled the attackers without a single casualty!
19,188,00:16:04,ishigami village has won this battle!
19,189,00:16:10,"you managed quite the achievement, suika."
19,190,00:16:14,"it was reckless as all get out, though."
19,191,00:16:19,we'll need to overwhelm them with numbers.
19,192,00:16:23,"tsukasa-kun and i will be among them, of course,"
19,193,00:16:26,"along with the most massive, powerful fighting force the empire can muster."
19,194,00:16:50,what are you going to do now?
19,195,00:16:52,tsukasa-chan's finally about to find out that you're alive.
19,196,00:16:56,"yeah, and he'll also figure out that we can't produce the gunpowder"
19,197,00:17:00,for guns fast enough.
19,198,00:17:02,"wait, we can't?"
19,199,00:17:05,what do you mean?
19,200,00:17:06,listen up. the revival fluid that tsukasa's guys have been cranking out
19,201,00:17:11,is actually pretty easy to make.
19,202,00:17:14,but we haven't revived a single statue.
19,203,00:17:18,and that's because we don't have the nitric acid we need.
19,204,00:17:21,"we could make some from dung or sea shells,"
19,205,00:17:24,but it'd take an insane amount and too much time.
19,206,00:17:26,"no nitric acid means no gunpowder, either."
19,207,00:17:30,tsukasa is smart enough to figure that out easily.
19,208,00:17:35,we don't even have any leftovers in our gunpowder supply.
19,209,00:17:39,"there's so much science lingo, i'm not quite following..."
19,210,00:17:43,"break it down more simply, would you?!"
19,211,00:17:46,"i'm trying to say that even if we have guns, he knows we can't really use them."
19,212,00:17:51,"and knowing tsukasa, he'll have a full army built up,"
19,213,00:17:55,ready for a huge invasion.
19,214,00:17:57,"the more time passes, the more fighters they have, after all..."
19,215,00:18:01,which doesn't apply to our gunpowder.
19,216,00:18:06,s-so what are we gonna do?!
19,217,00:18:09,that should be obvious.
19,218,00:18:12,we attack them first.
19,219,00:18:15,with one of our fun scientific inventions.
19,220,00:18:20,i agree.
19,221,00:18:21,waiting will put us at a disadvantage.
19,222,00:18:23,so the only option is to strike first!
19,223,00:18:26,"we've gotta put that weapon of science together first, though."
19,224,00:18:30,what is this weapon you're talking about?
19,225,00:18:34,go ahead and cry tears of joy!
19,226,00:18:36,it's time to break out the real modern tech!
19,227,00:18:41,the scientific advancements we've recreated from the stone age
19,228,00:18:44,will finally reach all the way into modernity!
19,229,00:18:48,this is the stuff that won wars in modern times.
19,230,00:18:52,the strongest weapon in two million years of human history...
19,231,00:18:55,"you... don't mean nukes, do you?"
19,232,00:18:57,nope.
19,233,00:18:59,the strongest weapon in two million years of human history:
19,234,00:19:02,communications technology.
19,235,00:19:05,"we're gonna make cellular phones, right here in the stone world!"
19,236,00:19:11,cell...
19,237,00:19:12,...ular...
19,238,00:19:13,...phones?
19,239,00:19:16,is he crazy? because he just said something really crazy.
19,240,00:19:22,a cellular phone?
19,241,00:19:24,what's that? some kind of fish?
19,242,00:19:29,from a distance?
19,243,00:19:31,so you can talk to someone...
19,244,00:19:34,...from really far away?
19,245,00:19:36,that is definitely sorcery!
19,246,00:19:38,is such a thing really possible?!
19,247,00:19:41,"oh, man! i wanna know how that works!"
19,248,00:19:45,and that'll be our weapon?
19,249,00:19:47,you bet it will. communications can completely turn the tide in a battle.
19,250,00:19:52,suppose we have a double agent who leaks intel to us in real time...
19,251,00:19:57,this is asagiri gen.
19,252,00:19:59,"senku-chan, the bad guys arewide open on the west side."
19,253,00:20:02,barely even any guards. over.
19,254,00:20:06,this is asagiri gen.
19,255,00:20:08,"senku-chan, the bad guys arewide open on the west side."
19,256,00:20:12,barely even any guards. over.
19,257,00:20:15,now that's some exhilarating intel!
19,258,00:20:17,we're gonna go nuts on their western flank!
19,259,00:20:20,"if we coordinate our efforts the right way,"
19,260,00:20:22,we might be able to dismantle the tsukasa empire without bloodshed.
19,261,00:20:26,but who would be our double agent?
19,262,00:20:34,they're already out there.
19,263,00:20:42,two of them: taiju and yuzuriha!
19,264,00:20:47,smartphones!
19,265,00:20:48,"sure, smartphones!"
19,266,00:20:50,"smartphones would be nice to have, huh?"
19,267,00:20:52,smartphones?!
19,268,00:20:54,you sure love your smartphone.
19,269,00:20:57,"that blockhead taiju wanted a smartphone so badly,"
19,270,00:21:02,and now it's finally going to happen.
19,271,00:21:12,"granted, this time it'll just be a regular phone, not the smart kind."
19,272,00:21:18,we can do this!
19,273,00:21:20,"we were able to make sulfa drugs, and they took a ton of work, too!"
19,274,00:21:25,"uh, listen..."
19,275,00:21:26,"you guys clearly aren't aware of this,"
19,276,00:21:28,but this road map is full of implausible things.
19,277,00:21:34,nothing implausible about it.
19,278,00:21:37,"no matter how far off the goal may seem,"
19,279,00:21:40,"if you stick to the rules, you'll get there ten billion percent of the time."

20,35,00:00:45,that's how science works.
20,36,00:00:49,we have a few months to finish it.
20,37,00:00:52,what do you mean?
20,38,00:00:53,that's how long we have before tsukasa's full-on assault.
20,39,00:00:57,"what's your take, mentalist?"
20,40,00:00:59,let's see...
20,41,00:01:00,thinking like tsukasa-chan...
20,42,00:01:09,we control the revival fluid.
20,43,00:01:11,"the more time that passes, the greater our advantage in manpower. yes."
20,44,00:01:15,but it's senku we're up against.
20,45,00:01:17,"if we give him too much time, he'll start mass-producing gunpowder."
20,46,00:01:23,your voice imitations are way too accurate.
20,47,00:01:28,we'll take every precaution to ensure that we defeat senku.
20,48,00:01:33,we're going to need to divert a lot of manpower in preparation for the winter.
20,49,00:01:40,"also, hyoga, according to your information,"
20,50,00:01:43,the kingdom of science is a fortress on water.
20,51,00:01:46,yes.
20,52,00:01:48,it's protected by a lake that all but freezes over in the winter.
20,53,00:01:51,"if they hold the fort, it will be difficult to attack."
20,54,00:01:54,our morale and food wouldn't outlast theirs in an encirclement.
20,55,00:01:59,first of all...
20,56,00:02:00,aren't taiju and yuzuriha in danger if tsukasa finds out you're still alive?
20,57,00:02:06,won't they be killed?
20,58,00:02:08,that won't be an issue.
20,59,00:02:11,those two are potential hostages to them.
20,60,00:02:13,they won't waste that.
20,61,00:02:18,is it safe to let taiju-kun and yuzuriha-kun roam free?
20,62,00:02:23,i'll have someone watch them.
20,63,00:02:25,but let's continue interacting with them as we have
20,64,00:02:27,so they won't suspect anything.
20,65,00:02:29,"even if taiju and yuzuriha are spies,"
20,66,00:02:33,there's no way for them to convey information in this world.
20,67,00:02:39,the greater concern is a preemptive attack from senku.
20,68,00:02:45,i have homura-kun keeping an eye on them.
20,69,00:02:47,"although we don't have any means of communication, either,"
20,70,00:02:50,so there's a delay in getting information.
20,71,00:02:55,how ironic.
20,72,00:02:58,the importance of communication and information transfer
20,73,00:03:02,is especially important in such a primitive battle.
20,74,00:03:07,the rules of the game are simple.
20,75,00:03:10,we're going to make cell phones in order to take tsukasa down with a preemptive strike.
20,76,00:03:17,so the battle will happen right after the winter snow melts.
20,77,00:03:21,our deadline is spring.
20,78,00:04:55,{\an8}the age of energy
20,79,00:05:06,it sure makes a difference having so many people to help.
20,80,00:05:10,it's all because senku won the seat of the village chief.
20,81,00:05:14,good news indeed.

20,106,00:05:17,we're taking on the huge task of making
20,107,00:05:20,cell phones in the stone world.
20,108,00:05:23,there's a mountain of hurdles we need to clear.
20,109,00:05:26,"oh, yeah!"
20,110,00:05:28,that cell phone thing!
20,111,00:05:29,tell me how it lets you talk to people really far away!
20,112,00:05:32,"c'mon, tell me! hurry up!"
20,113,00:05:34,how does it work?!
20,114,00:05:36,hurry up and tell me!
20,115,00:05:38,give me some space!
20,116,00:05:40,you're getting way too excited.
20,117,00:05:43,listen up.
20,118,00:05:44,your voice is a vibration of air.
20,119,00:05:47,"point that vibration at a diaphragm,"
20,120,00:05:50,and it produces a super tiny electrical current in rhythm with the vibration.
20,121,00:05:55,"oh, damn!"
20,122,00:05:56,"{\an8}oh, damn!"
20,123,00:06:00,"the current is way too small, of course, so you blow it up."
20,124,00:06:04,"for our purposes, we're using a vacuum tube."
20,125,00:06:07,"then, we send it around and around in a circle,"
20,126,00:06:11,which sends it flowing in a wave of power.
20,127,00:06:14,"{\an8}oh, damn!"
20,128,00:06:15,that's called a radio wave.
20,129,00:06:18,the listening side just does the exact opposite.
20,130,00:06:18,"{\an8}oh, damn!"
20,131,00:06:23,"{\an8}oh, damn!"
20,132,00:06:25,o-oh! i got about half of that!
20,133,00:06:29,i got none of it.
20,134,00:06:31,"this conversation's so high-iq, it's making my head hurt."
20,135,00:06:35,what exactly are we going to make first?
20,136,00:06:39,the first thing we're making inour giant science project is...
20,137,00:06:46,a cotton candy machine.
20,138,00:06:48,cot...
20,139,00:06:49,...ton...
20,140,00:06:50,...can...
20,141,00:06:51,...dy?
20,142,00:06:55,"the conversation's iq just dropped by, like, a hundred."
20,143,00:07:00,are you okay?
20,144,00:07:06,making... something.
20,145,00:07:09,new weapon?
20,146,00:07:33,what's this?
20,147,00:07:36,you put sugar crystals in here and spin it around.
20,148,00:07:39,"the centrifugal force pushes the molten sugar out through the small holes,"
20,149,00:07:44,resulting in thin strands.
20,150,00:07:47,that makes cotton candy.
20,151,00:07:49,but what do you think would happen if you used gold instead of sugar?
20,152,00:07:57,we'll get gold threads!
20,153,00:07:59,correct. ten billion points.
20,154,00:08:01,"oh, like the wires in electronics."
20,155,00:08:05,the conversation's iq is finally going back up.
20,156,00:08:09,all right!
20,157,00:08:10,let's go get the gold!
20,158,00:08:12,"no, gold's precious."
20,159,00:08:14,we can't afford to mess up.
20,160,00:08:16,let's try cotton candy first.
20,161,00:08:19,we have to test it out.
20,162,00:08:24,"ah, you're right."
20,163,00:08:26,"we need to taste... i mean, test it."
20,164,00:08:35,someone named homura started this fire.
20,165,00:08:39,we lost a lot of potato wine and mirin that was almost ready.
20,166,00:08:43,it was burning for a long time.
20,167,00:08:46,look.
20,168,00:08:48,it's turned into chunks on the rims of the barrels.
20,169,00:08:51,what are we doing with the damaged wine?
20,170,00:08:53,this is stuff you can get by boiling wine and mirin for a really long time.
20,171,00:08:58,they're sugar crystals.
20,172,00:09:12,what's that fluffy stuff?
20,173,00:09:14,"man, it smells so good."
20,174,00:09:19,"it's so white, like a cloud."
20,175,00:09:37,this is indescribable!
20,176,00:09:41,it's going to melt me to my core.
20,177,00:09:44,it is!
20,178,00:09:47,"here, father, try some."
20,179,00:09:50,it's rather suspicious-looking.
20,180,00:10:05,they've never had any actual candy before.
20,181,00:10:07,{\an8}it's so good!
20,182,00:10:10,yeah.
20,183,00:10:11,"it's just cotton candy, but for someone who's never had it before,"
20,184,00:10:14,it must be a mind-blowingly pleasurable drug.
20,185,00:10:18,gotta thank homura-chan for making the materials for us
20,186,00:10:22,"by starting that fire, huh?"
20,187,00:10:26,gen...
20,188,00:10:28,do you know what kind of woman homura is?
20,189,00:10:33,"what's going on? do you get curious about girls, too, senku?"
20,190,00:10:39,do you have a thing for petite girls?
20,191,00:10:41,"no, i don't think that's what he meant."
20,192,00:10:44,you guys don't know senku very well.
20,193,00:10:47,we're being watched.
20,194,00:10:49,all of us.
20,195,00:10:50,by that homura chick.
20,196,00:10:53,i'm sure we are.
20,197,00:10:55,she's the only one hyoga-chan trusts.
20,198,00:10:59,even right now?
20,199,00:11:00,of course she's watching us.
20,200,00:11:02,"from a good distance, where she can see if we make any big moves,"
20,201,00:11:06,so she can chase us down if we were all to run away.
20,202,00:11:13,i thought we'd just run away if things got bad.
20,203,00:11:16,not that we'd ever run away.
20,204,00:11:19,indeed. we have many elderly people who couldn't endure a move.
20,205,00:11:22,there are no cowards in this village who would leave the elderly behind.
20,206,00:11:27,eep!
20,207,00:11:28,n-nope!
20,208,00:11:29,of course there aren't!
20,209,00:11:31,"well, homura-chan respects hyoga-sama like crazy."
20,210,00:11:35,she'd never disobey him if he told her to watch us.
20,211,00:11:39,"so she won't cause us any trouble if we leave her be,"
20,212,00:11:43,but i don't think we could get her to switch sides or anything.
20,213,00:12:14,cotton candy
20,214,00:12:14,cotton candy?
20,215,00:12:20,"don't worry, it's not poisoned or anything."
20,216,00:12:23,give half of it to an animal if you're worried.
20,217,00:12:30,fool. not trying it.
20,218,00:12:34,"hey, senku, why did we give an enemy cotton candy?"
20,219,00:12:39,"if homura's keeping an eye on us,"
20,220,00:12:41,she'll let tsukasa know about the cotton candy.
20,221,00:12:44,sweets are crazy tempting.
20,222,00:12:47,some of them might rethink their allegiance.
20,223,00:12:51,i see.
20,224,00:12:52,"you're as nasty as ever, senku-chan."
20,225,00:12:55,"i mean that as a compliment, honestly."
20,226,00:13:04,"i'm sure he means that in a strategic way, too..."
20,227,00:13:12,but i think senku-san also just wanted
20,228,00:13:17,to share some candy with a girl.
20,229,00:13:23,i think that's all he really meant.
20,230,00:13:29,we're dealing with people so naïve that theywouldn't even abandon a village guard.
20,231,00:13:35,one lick... i'm dead?
20,232,00:13:38,surely not.
20,233,00:13:59,sweet...
20,234,00:14:08,senkutei
20,235,00:14:11,p-p-please and thank you.
20,236,00:14:24,this cotton candy...
20,237,00:14:27,"it's puffy and melts on my tongue,"
20,238,00:14:30,yet it has a good amount of roughness.
20,239,00:14:33,alas!
20,240,00:14:34,the inconsistency of the cotton is defeating the flavor's balance.
20,241,00:14:40,i'll work harder next time!
20,242,00:14:43,"wait, no!"
20,243,00:14:44,you just made me go along with a meme!
20,244,00:14:47,who cares about how well-balanced cotton candy is?!
20,245,00:14:50,"you guys got the word ""meme,"" huh?"
20,246,00:14:53,was that in the hundred tales?
20,247,00:14:55,"damn it, my dad is such a joke."
20,248,00:14:58,do we really have so much time to waste?!
20,249,00:15:01,tsukasa-kun's gonna be here before our phone's done!
20,250,00:15:05,relax.
20,251,00:15:07,we're discussing a serious matter.
20,252,00:15:09,the flavor of cotton candy?
20,253,00:15:11,"if the cotton candy ends up with a bunch of clumps,"
20,254,00:15:14,"so will the gold wire, right?"
20,255,00:15:18,"oh, that makes sense!"
20,256,00:15:20,"man, good thing we tested with cotton candy first, huh?"
20,257,00:15:24,yeah.
20,258,00:15:25,we have to figure out what's causing the clumps before we throw in the gold.
20,259,00:15:29,"we're always doing last-minute trial-and-error, huh?"
20,260,00:15:42,there!
20,261,00:15:45,yeah.
20,262,00:15:46,it's the moment the rope's tugged in the opposite direction.
20,263,00:15:49,"the rotation speed drops, which causes it to clump up."
20,264,00:15:53,is there a way to make it work smoothly without losing speed?
20,265,00:15:57,"using your brotherly bond, maybe?"
20,266,00:15:59,that's crazy.
20,267,00:16:02,then let's use a stupidly long rope.
20,268,00:16:05,"like, a kilometer long."
20,269,00:16:06,i'll die!
20,270,00:16:07,"how about we spin it by hand, like that generator over there?"
20,271,00:16:11,that's too slow.
20,272,00:16:13,that's what willpower's for!
20,273,00:16:14,maybe if we take turns.
20,274,00:16:17,"we need people, though."
20,275,00:16:20,we need to start preparing for winter.
20,276,00:16:22,we can't give all our manpower to science work.
20,277,00:16:25,"that's always the issue, huh?"
20,278,00:16:27,we can't use revival fluid to get more people.
20,279,00:16:34,"guess we'll have to make it, then."
20,280,00:16:38,"it's a bit of work, but super craftsman kaseki-sama can pull it off."
20,281,00:16:47,we're making what revolutionized energy in human history...
20,282,00:16:50,the gear!
20,283,00:16:53,"kohaku's shield, just when we need it!"
20,284,00:16:56,it's ten billion percent the right shape for a gear.
20,285,00:17:00,you're using that?
20,286,00:17:03,didn't the village chief give that to his daughter
20,287,00:17:06,kohaku-chan to celebrate his victory?
20,288,00:17:08,...to his daughter kohaku-chan?
20,289,00:17:10,...to his daughter kohaku-chan?
20,290,00:17:12,grand bout victor: kokuyo!
20,291,00:17:16,congrats!
20,292,00:17:19,this is so nice.
20,293,00:17:21,"all right, you can have it."
20,294,00:17:24,"thank you, father!"
20,295,00:17:26,father!
20,296,00:17:27,father!
20,297,00:17:28,"well, i don't mind, but..."
20,298,00:17:33,"it means a lot to kohaku, since she received it from her father."
20,299,00:17:38,so i don't know what she would say.
20,300,00:17:40,"nah, i don't mind at all."
20,301,00:17:43,practicality first.
20,302,00:17:45,so savage!
20,303,00:17:55,this is amazing!
20,304,00:17:56,it's so easy!
20,305,00:17:57,"i only have to go in one direction, and i can go slowly!"
20,306,00:18:00,i could keep going forever on my own!
20,307,00:18:03,{\an4}gear acquired!!
20,308,00:18:09,can go slowly?
20,309,00:18:11,forever in one direction?
20,310,00:18:15,it spins around and catches...
20,311,00:18:19,holy crap! i have an idea!
20,312,00:18:22,this is gonna rock!
20,313,00:18:25,what's gotten into you?!
20,314,00:18:27,just hear me out!
20,315,00:18:35,right! let's haul ass!
20,316,00:18:40,that's suspicious.
20,317,00:18:42,what's chrome up to?
20,318,00:18:44,he must've come up with some scheme.
20,319,00:18:47,let him be.
20,320,00:18:48,"when a boy's up to mischief, you're not supposed to look until he's done."
20,321,00:18:54,we don't have time to be worrying about him.
20,322,00:18:57,you're all in for hellish work.
20,323,00:19:01,we twist these gold threads together into asuper thin wire that we'll work into a coil.
20,324,00:19:07,and how long do we need to make it?
20,325,00:19:10,i'd say...
20,326,00:19:12,from right around here...
20,327,00:19:14,to that mountain!
20,328,00:19:17,so we're relying heavily on manpower again.
20,329,00:19:20,"thank goodness you became the village chief, huh, senku-chan?"
20,330,00:20:11,"it's... it's done, senku."
20,331,00:20:16,we stayed up for three whole days.
20,332,00:20:29,what is this?
20,333,00:20:36,"i'm awesome, too, but it's this blade of science that's really awesome."
20,334,00:20:40,it would have never worked if i didn't have this iron cutting tool.
20,335,00:20:45,this damn thing!
20,336,00:20:46,"what do you think, senku?"
20,337,00:20:47,is my invention awesome or what?
20,338,00:20:49,this is payback for when you got me good with the magnet!
20,339,00:20:54,you can be more shocked than that.
20,340,00:20:57,it's a waterwheel.
20,341,00:20:58,you do know what it is?! damn it!
20,342,00:21:01,a waterwheel?
20,343,00:21:03,i'd already come up with a name for it!
20,344,00:21:06,the forever spinny cotton candy machine!
20,345,00:21:08,i like waterwheel better.
20,346,00:21:11,"oh, i'm plenty shocked, all right."
20,347,00:21:14,i can't believe you built something like this without any knowledge.
20,348,00:21:24,this is a way bigger deal than an automatic cotton candy machine.
20,349,00:21:29,"there's something else, remember?"
20,350,00:21:32,that thing kinro and ginro had been spinning.
20,351,00:21:38,you don't mean...
20,352,00:21:47,"with gears and a waterwheel, the age of human power is over."
20,353,00:21:56,with an infinite contraption that requires no fuel...
20,354,00:22:02,we're finally harnessing the power of nature.
20,355,00:22:10,we're overcoming manpower and entering the age of energy!

21,12,00:01:00,they built this huge-ass waterwheel.
21,13,00:01:04,"it's not done yet, though."
21,14,00:01:06,all our precious electricity is still leaking away.
21,15,00:01:11,what does that mean?
21,16,00:01:13,we're building a box to store the electricity.
21,17,00:01:16,we can store that spinning power?
21,18,00:01:19,"yeah, although it'll be a bit of a pain to build."
21,19,00:01:23,get off your asses.

21,43,00:01:26,{\an8}cell phone
21,44,00:01:26,we have a ton of high-difficulty crafting to do
21,45,00:01:30,before we get to our cell phones.
21,46,00:01:35,damn...
21,47,00:01:37,it's the start of our spartan crafts club.
21,48,00:01:41,"damn, this is exhilarating."
21,49,00:03:14,{\an8}spartan crafts club
21,50,00:03:22,"to make a box for storing electricity, a battery, all we need to do"
21,51,00:03:26,"is dip two sheets of lead in our old two-faced goddess friend, sulfuric acid."
21,52,00:03:34,ryu-san?
21,53,00:03:36,"oh, sulfuric acid."
21,54,00:03:37,"send electricity into this, and it'll store power on its own."
21,55,00:03:42,"it's simpler than you'd think, huh?"
21,56,00:03:44,it's not simple at all.
21,57,00:03:45,this is pretty brutal.
21,58,00:03:46,we'll make five more of these and connect all of them.
21,59,00:03:50,don't you think the crafts team has been working a bit too hard lately?
21,60,00:03:59,{\an4}batteries acquired!!
21,61,00:04:01,is it really being stored in these tiny containers?
21,62,00:04:05,all the spinning power from those disk—
21,63,00:04:08,it's definitely in there.
21,64,00:04:10,{\an8}battery
21,65,00:04:15,does that mean i don't have to do all that painful turning with kinro anymore?!
21,66,00:04:21,yep. never again.
21,67,00:04:24,"i told you, it's the age of energy."
21,68,00:04:28,hooray for energy!
21,69,00:04:31,"i'm not surprised about lazy ginro,"
21,70,00:04:33,but even super-diligent kinro is excited.
21,71,00:04:36,turning that thing must've been really hard.
21,72,00:04:39,it's not meant to make your lives easier.
21,73,00:04:41,it just means we're using your manpower elsewhere.
21,74,00:04:43,the fighters can focus on training.
21,75,00:04:47,put your back into it!
21,76,00:04:51,we only have a few months until the big battle.
21,77,00:04:54,you need to be in shape to defeat tsukasa and hyoga!
21,78,00:04:58,"this isn't the time to be taking a break, you two."
21,79,00:05:01,this is way too spartan!
21,80,00:05:03,grandpa kaseki's going to die!
21,81,00:05:05,there's one more vitally important use for the waterwheel.
21,82,00:05:11,it's time for some fun gear-making.
21,83,00:05:13,it'll work magic on the waterwheel's motion.
21,84,00:05:18,damn it. it broke again.
21,85,00:05:20,back to copying the designs again.
21,86,00:05:27,"the teeth on just half of the disk catch the top and bottom in turn,"
21,87,00:05:33,and that turns a rotational motion into a back-and-forth motion.
21,88,00:05:37,these ideas humanity came up with are incredible.
21,89,00:05:40,this is insane.
21,90,00:05:42,the craftsman in me is getting way too excited.
21,91,00:05:45,it's pissing me off.
21,92,00:05:47,"here, leave the intricate work to the pro."
21,93,00:05:52,"they were so worn out when they saw the diagram,"
21,94,00:05:55,and now they're being all tough.
21,95,00:06:07,i-is this...
21,96,00:06:10,it's the air-blowing machine for building fires!
21,97,00:06:13,level one!
21,98,00:06:14,level 1
21,99,00:06:15,level two!
21,100,00:06:16,level 2
21,101,00:06:17,"and finally, level three!"
21,102,00:06:18,level 3
21,103,00:06:24,this was the hardest work we had to do in exchange for ramen.
21,104,00:06:29,the hellish iron-making work is finally mechanized!
21,105,00:06:32,hooray for energy!
21,106,00:06:35,"i told you, this doesn't mean you can slack off!"
21,107,00:06:37,the non-fighters can focus on preparing for the winter.
21,108,00:06:46,"everything i see, i see for the first time."
21,109,00:06:50,"this is called bottling, huh?"
21,110,00:06:52,it's the ancestor of canning.
21,111,00:06:55,i can't believe we can preserve meat for the winter. i must be in heaven.
21,112,00:07:00,what's the spartan crafts club making this time?
21,113,00:07:04,light bulbs.
21,114,00:07:07,"sure, that's crazy enough."
21,115,00:07:10,"i'm starting to get used to it, though."
21,116,00:07:13,"it gets up to about 2,000 degrees once it's lit."
21,117,00:07:16,that makes the metal connections melt apart.
21,118,00:07:19,we're going to have to use glass as a tiny adhesive.
21,119,00:07:24,"this is so intricate, it's tough even for me."
21,120,00:07:30,damn it! this is so hard!
21,121,00:07:34,what's the matter? giving up already?
21,122,00:07:37,not at all.
21,123,00:07:38,although my body gave up a long time ago.
21,124,00:07:41,i always know i can count on a craftsman.
21,125,00:07:44,sheesh.
21,126,00:07:45,i've lived such an easy life here for the past sixty years.
21,127,00:07:50,"but senku, ever since you showed up,"
21,128,00:07:54,"it's been so much harder,"
21,129,00:07:57,and so much more fun.
21,130,00:08:01,"aside from a few, i bet everyone in the village feels the same way."
21,131,00:09:10,{\an8}ramen
21,132,00:09:42,wow.
21,133,00:09:43,"last time we made a light, though, it burnt out instantly."
21,134,00:09:51,what do we do?
21,135,00:09:52,what do you do to make things burn fast?
21,136,00:09:56,you give it a ton of air with a blowing machine.
21,137,00:09:58,"like we did with the waterwheel, right?"
21,138,00:10:00,then what do you do to keep things from burning?
21,139,00:10:06,you get rid of the air?
21,140,00:10:12,"we use the hefty weight of mercury to catch the air as it falls,"
21,141,00:10:18,air
21,142,00:10:19,air
21,143,00:10:19,creating a vacuum.
21,144,00:10:34,"no matter how hot it gets, if there's no air, it won't burn."
21,145,00:10:40,that's how it can last a long time without burning out.
21,146,00:10:53,"senku, i've brought everyone here."
21,147,00:10:56,"okay, hang on."
21,148,00:10:59,it's almost time.
21,149,00:11:03,"damn, it's snowing."
21,150,00:11:05,are we calling off the test?
21,151,00:11:06,"no, i'd like to do it today."
21,152,00:11:11,we're all set.
21,153,00:11:15,"all right, let's turn it on."
21,154,00:11:36,they're like twinkling stars!
21,155,00:11:39,decorative lighting.
21,156,00:11:41,i feel like i'm back in the modern world.
21,157,00:11:45,it took two months to get here.
21,158,00:11:48,that took a while.
21,159,00:11:49,"nah, we're right on schedule, really."
21,160,00:11:55,"hang on, is today christmas?"
21,161,00:12:00,"oh, yeah, now that you mention it..."
21,162,00:12:05,what a coincidence.
21,163,00:12:07,"yeah, right."
21,164,00:12:30,"oh, damn! i have an idea!"
21,165,00:12:32,"we can go deep into the caves, farther than we could with torches!"
21,166,00:12:33,{\an8}'sup?
21,167,00:12:38,"right, with batteries and light bulbs, we could go ten billion times deeper."
21,168,00:12:42,i bet there are tons of cool rocks deep in the caves!
21,169,00:12:46,"let's go, science spelunkers!"
21,170,00:12:48,we're going to find some awesome mineral resources!
21,171,00:12:51,"yo, senku, you may be way ahead of me in science,"
21,172,00:12:55,"but when it comes to exploring, i'm tens of billions of times better than you!"
21,173,00:12:58,i'm sure. you've had years at it.
21,174,00:13:00,what do you want?
21,175,00:13:02,captain chrome will go get it for you!
21,176,00:13:05,"there's gotta be stuff on the cell phone road map that we don't have, right?"
21,177,00:13:09,"oh, materials we're missing?"
21,178,00:13:13,nothing.
21,179,00:13:13,there's nothing?!
21,180,00:13:15,we have everything we need.

21,204,00:13:17,{\an8}cell phone
21,205,00:13:17,thanks to our hard work in our past missions.
21,206,00:13:21,"then is there a reason to go exploring now,"
21,207,00:13:24,when we're so short on labor?
21,208,00:13:26,"i bet he just wants to go exploring, now that he has some new gear."
21,209,00:13:31,gulp!
21,210,00:13:34,"well, it would be nice to have a ton of copper."
21,211,00:13:37,there's no telling how much we're going to use during our next brutal crafting session.
21,212,00:13:41,that's it!
21,213,00:13:43,i got this!
21,214,00:13:44,come home soon.
21,215,00:13:46,at least by new year's next week.
21,216,00:13:50,so what's this brutal crafting?
21,217,00:13:53,i want to have it done by the time chrome's back so we can surprise him.
21,218,00:13:58,the next-level light bulb.
21,219,00:14:01,the light bulb was already brutal.
21,220,00:14:04,this sounds exciting.
21,221,00:14:06,we're making computer eggs.
21,222,00:14:09,the gears of electrons...
21,223,00:14:11,vacuum tubes.
21,224,00:14:17,"vacuum tubes, huh?"
21,225,00:14:20,we're getting to the point where i have no idea what you're making.
21,226,00:14:23,"i mean, i do."
21,227,00:14:24,"i know of the name, but if you asked me what exactly they do..."
21,228,00:14:30,"they emit electrons at high temperatures,"
21,229,00:14:33,letting us control the direction of the current and make it stronger.
21,230,00:14:37,just think of them as the gears of the electricity world.
21,231,00:14:41,it's the heart of a cell phone.
21,232,00:14:44,"this is tough work, but it's almost the same as making a light bulb."
21,233,00:14:49,yeah.
21,234,00:14:50,"but as the name suggests, it's a vacuum tube,"
21,235,00:14:54,so we really need to get rid of all the air.
21,236,00:14:58,"so we put phosphorus on the filament, where it gets hot."
21,237,00:15:02,"it'll burn with heat, suck up all the air around it, and..."
21,238,00:15:08,i didn't do anything.
21,239,00:15:10,it cracked at the base.
21,240,00:15:14,the wires are expanding...
21,241,00:15:18,the metal line going through the glass
21,242,00:15:21,expands just a little from the heat of burning phosphorus.
21,243,00:15:24,that size difference of just a few microns broke the glass.
21,244,00:15:27,is that the level of intricacy we're dealing with?
21,245,00:15:30,"what do we do, then?"
21,246,00:15:35,"nothing ever works right on the first try, does it?"
21,247,00:15:40,it's nothing but trial and error.
21,248,00:15:43,when is it ever anything else?
21,249,00:15:47,i'm back!
21,250,00:15:51,and i copped some copper!
21,251,00:15:54,no pun intended.
21,252,00:15:57,this is just the right time for that copper.
21,253,00:16:06,a copper tube?
21,254,00:16:09,a tube will just expand inward without cracking the glass around it.
21,255,00:16:15,"finally! man, making that vacuum tube was hard work."
21,256,00:16:26,damn... the bamboo filament burnt out instantly.
21,257,00:16:43,damn it.
21,258,00:16:44,bamboo filaments are just fundamentally too weak for vacuum tubes.
21,259,00:16:50,"i don't get the science, but bamboo is too weak, is that right?"
21,260,00:16:55,what do we need?
21,261,00:16:56,"if we need something tougher, i'll go find it!"
21,262,00:16:59,no...
21,263,00:17:04,there's nothing better in this age.
21,264,00:17:16,these are all the minerals i found lying around in the caves.
21,265,00:17:20,there must be something in here that's strong enough to hold up to the heat.
21,266,00:17:25,this one's like a gem!
21,267,00:17:27,that's a jewel bug corpse.
21,268,00:17:30,"what about this rock? it's really dark,"
21,269,00:17:33,but light as a feather!
21,270,00:17:34,raccoon poop.
21,271,00:17:35,"well, poop!"
21,272,00:17:42,i guess we're stuck.
21,273,00:17:43,after we came so far...
21,274,00:17:53,"i'm not a rock doctor like senku,"
21,275,00:17:57,but i've seen a lot of rocks while playing in the mountains and forests.
21,276,00:18:02,i'm going to find an unusual rock that might be helpful
21,277,00:18:06,and be useful to everyone.
21,278,00:18:24,"if we can't do cell phones, we can't do cell phones."
21,279,00:18:27,i don't have time to be bummed out.
21,280,00:18:30,think of something else.
21,281,00:18:33,"senku-chan, wakey-wakey!"
21,282,00:18:37,it's the new year.
21,283,00:18:39,we should all watch the sunrise together.
21,284,00:18:44,it's important to have a change of pace and a fresh mindset.
21,285,00:18:47,"that's my line of work, right?"
21,286,00:18:49,mentalists are such a pain.
21,287,00:18:53,"i-i'm coming, too!"
21,288,00:18:57,"wait, suika, were you going through rocks all night?"
21,289,00:19:00,that's right.
21,290,00:19:03,that's right.
21,291,00:19:05,"new year's, huh?"
21,292,00:19:07,"our internal clocks are messed up from the petrification, though."
21,293,00:19:11,i don't even know how old i am anymore.
21,294,00:19:14,think about how many days you've been alive.
21,295,00:19:18,why would we remember that?
21,296,00:19:22,what about you?
21,297,00:19:24,"6,268 days."
21,298,00:19:31,we're almost there.
21,299,00:19:42,the sun's rising.
21,300,00:20:03,it's blue.
21,301,00:20:06,a gemstone...
21,302,00:20:09,it's pretty.
21,303,00:20:13,why... is it glowing?
21,304,00:20:17,it's called scheelite.
21,305,00:20:19,it glows blue when exposed to ultraviolet light.
21,306,00:20:24,reactions to ultraviolet light are especially visible
21,307,00:20:27,right before the sun rises.
21,308,00:20:29,"in other words, only right now."
21,309,00:20:32,a magic stone that glows just for this moment...

22,8,00:00:36,let's go cave diving. we're a trio of spelunking buddies.
22,9,00:00:41,to the fun treasure dungeon!
22,10,00:00:45,"senku, chrome, and magma?!"
22,11,00:00:49,i've never heard of such a risky group.
22,12,00:00:52,i-i-is that even safe?
22,13,00:00:54,"he might be like, ""i'm the chief!"" and attack you or something, senku!"
22,14,00:00:59,"come on, let's get going,"
22,15,00:01:02,the three of us.
22,16,00:01:03,{\an5}vacuum tube
22,17,00:01:04,we're after the magic stone that we'll need for making vacuum tube filaments:
22,18,00:01:09,"scheelite, which glows blue under ultraviolet light."
22,19,00:01:12,"the most heat-resistant metal in the world, tungsten!"
22,20,00:01:17,"this chunk came down a stream in the cave, too."
22,21,00:01:20,there must be a treasure trove further in.
22,22,00:01:22,"i'm counting on you to take us to the cave, chrome."
22,23,00:01:26,got it!
22,24,00:01:28,going into the caves with two science users...
22,25,00:01:31,no one will be watching.
22,26,00:01:53,he's finally gone.
22,27,00:01:57,senku-chan's gone from ishigami village.
22,28,00:03:44,the water's lukewarm.
22,29,00:03:48,we can definitely expect some treasures.
22,30,00:04:01,"yo, senku..."
22,31,00:04:03,was it honestly a good idea to bring magma along?
22,32,00:04:07,he's a meathead who doesn't care about anything but being king of the hill.
22,33,00:04:11,he's totally intent on snuffing you out
22,34,00:04:13,when you least expect it and taking over the village.
22,35,00:04:17,think about what's going on.
22,36,00:04:19,we desperately need tungsten in order to make cell phones.
22,37,00:04:24,"that treasure is in the depths of the cave,"
22,38,00:04:26,"and to dig it out, we need magma's power desperately."
22,39,00:04:30,the situation is ten billion percent simple.
22,40,00:04:34,"we have to do it, so there's no point in thinking about the buts, what-ifs, or risks."
22,41,00:04:41,"still, though..."
22,42,00:04:43,"if magma were to shove us down and say we died in an accident,"
22,43,00:04:46,it'd be the perfect crime.
22,44,00:04:48,"besides, if he takes our heads to tsukasa, and science vanishes,"
22,45,00:04:52,tsukasa won't attack.
22,46,00:04:55,no way the meathead's thought that far ahead.
22,47,00:05:08,get back!
22,48,00:05:11,"what's up, senku?"
22,49,00:05:14,it's mica.
22,50,00:05:15,"it's like baumkuchen... which doesn't help, i guess."
22,51,00:05:19,"even though it's a rock, it's brittle enough to break with your fingers."
22,52,00:05:24,look.
22,53,00:05:26,they're natural pit traps.
22,54,00:05:28,"damn, nature's traps are nasty."
22,55,00:05:33,would you be stuck if you fell into one?
22,56,00:05:36,yeah.
22,57,00:05:37,"try to get back up with a rope or ladder,"
22,58,00:05:39,and it'll cave in on you and bury you alive.
22,59,00:06:00,"no! let go, senku!"
22,60,00:06:02,it's going to cave in under your feet!
22,61,00:06:05,didn't you see that?
22,62,00:06:06,magma tried to shove us into the mica pits!
22,63,00:06:18,"yeah, that's right!"
22,64,00:06:20,i came to this cave to kill you two!
22,65,00:06:23,"you little twigs act so big, but you're so useless, you can hardly even hunt!"
22,66,00:06:30,"the strongest becomes the boss and gets the women,"
22,67,00:06:33,and the village becomes stronger.
22,68,00:06:35,that's mother nature.
22,69,00:06:36,that's life.
22,70,00:06:38,"""science,"" my ass!"
22,71,00:06:40,"senku, maybe in your world, the twigs controlled the muscles,"
22,72,00:06:46,but this is the world of stone!
22,73,00:06:49,you're the one getting in our way!
22,74,00:06:52,"damn it, senku, if only you hadn't come to ishigami village that day,"
22,75,00:06:59,i would have been in power.
22,76,00:07:02,i'm the one who's truly strong.
22,77,00:07:07,i'm the number one man!
22,78,00:07:15,senku! magma!
22,79,00:07:38,quit wandering around!
22,80,00:07:40,you're getting on my nerves!
22,81,00:07:42,i'm measuring stuff.
22,82,00:07:44,there's no way we're getting out of this hole.
22,83,00:07:47,it's ten billion times better than just sitting and waiting like some idiot.
22,84,00:07:51,"keep raising your voice like a dumbass, and it'll cave in and bury us alive."
22,85,00:07:56,you damn twig...
22,86,00:08:02,are you messing with me?!
22,87,00:08:05,"i'll kill you, you little twig!"
22,88,00:08:06,"i told you, it'll cave in if you keep shouting."
22,89,00:08:13,"if we keep pouring in water from that pond over there,"
22,90,00:08:16,you might be able to swim back out.
22,91,00:08:22,it's never going to work if you pour it that slowly!
22,92,00:08:25,"slow and steady wins the race, right?"
22,93,00:08:27,it's better than doing nothing!
22,94,00:08:29,hang on.
22,95,00:08:30,that's not bad.
22,96,00:08:34,we have no use for resignation or for arguing about diligence.
22,97,00:08:37,science determines whether it'll work or not.
22,98,00:08:41,connecting the gas mask tubes will give us a good meter of drop height from the surface.
22,99,00:08:45,"if the inner diameter of the tube is two centimeters, by torricelli's law,"
22,100,00:08:48,the flow will be 0.00139 cubic meters per second.
22,101,00:08:51,"if the hole is 28 cubic meters, that's 20131.68 seconds, or 5.59 hours."
22,102,00:08:51,"{\an7}q: flow\h\h\h\hq=av (a: tube cross-section area, v: fluid speed)\h\h\h\hv=√2gh (torricelli's law)\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(g: gravitational acceleration, h: height of fluid surface)"

22,103,00:08:58,"since it's lukewarm, we should just barely avoid hypothermia."
22,104,00:09:05,"chrome, i'm going to tell you how to craft something."
22,105,00:09:08,can you do it?
22,106,00:09:11,"yeah, of course i can."
22,107,00:09:13,don't underestimate chrome the science user!
22,108,00:09:26,see? i told you.
22,109,00:09:28,we're screwed if any one of us is missing.
22,110,00:09:31,the twigs controlled the muscles in my world?
22,111,00:09:35,obviously not.
22,112,00:09:37,we were just divvying up the work.
22,113,00:09:39,"in a technological civilization, you need twigs like us,"
22,114,00:09:43,and we need brawny meatheads like you.
22,115,00:09:47,even someone who's got nothing going for them can come in useful someday.
22,116,00:09:52,it doesn't matter who's the boss or who's on top.
22,117,00:09:56,there are all kinds of people.
22,118,00:09:58,and that equals strength.
22,119,00:10:02,i don't care about your babble.
22,120,00:10:04,"senku, you took the throne from me."
22,121,00:10:08,that's all.
22,122,00:10:09,"yeah, you're right."
22,123,00:10:12,but in exchange...
22,124,00:10:19,you get to see all the insane stuff that humanity worked together
22,125,00:10:22,for two million years to build.stuff you never would've seen otherwise.
22,126,00:10:26,"and i'll show you so much of it, it'll make your head spin."
22,127,00:10:46,how is the water going from low to high?
22,128,00:10:50,time for happy grade school science: the siphon!
22,129,00:10:54,"i'll explain, just in case."
22,130,00:10:56,"fill a tube with water, then take it to a point lower than the water surface."
22,131,00:11:02,the water will flow upward and continue flowing.
22,132,00:11:05,it'll even work in your bathtub. give it a try.
22,133,00:11:16,this is bad.
22,134,00:11:18,"it's going to take a while longer for the water to fill up,"
22,135,00:11:20,but senku's almost out of energy.
22,136,00:11:25,"you go ahead and get up, little twig."
22,137,00:11:29,"i'm the number one power of the ishigami village, living by the sea."
22,138,00:11:32,don't underestimate me.
22,139,00:11:37,senku!
22,140,00:11:39,i don't care if you're the boss anymore.
22,141,00:11:42,"at least, until we deal with that tsukasa guy."
22,142,00:11:45,"but if you show me anything lame, i'll kill you!"
22,143,00:11:58,"yeah, that works for me."
22,144,00:12:02,there's no way science could be lame.
22,145,00:12:16,magma's brute strength got us out of the worst-case scenario.
22,146,00:12:22,worst-case scenario?
22,147,00:12:23,the fact that we'd have been dead had our bodies gotten any colder.
22,148,00:12:28,this is why i can't stand you little twigs.
22,149,00:12:31,no.
22,150,00:12:33,the worst-case scenario that would have occurred if we'd gotten any colder...
22,151,00:12:37,is...
22,152,00:12:40,magma and i would've had to holdeach other to maintain our body heat.
22,153,00:12:46,that definitely is the worst-case scenario.
22,154,00:13:23,i was right!
22,155,00:13:26,i found it.
22,156,00:13:27,this striped rock face...
22,157,00:13:30,this dungeon we're currently in...
22,158,00:13:34,it's a skarn deposit.
22,159,00:13:36,we can get a stupid amount of sweet minerals here.
22,160,00:13:39,it's nature's treasure chest.
22,161,00:13:42,this is crazy!
22,162,00:13:44,"white, black, blue, gold..."
22,163,00:13:47,it really is clearly separated into stripes!
22,164,00:13:50,i've never seen a rock like this!
22,165,00:13:53,"a rock is a rock, isn't it?"
22,166,00:13:55,"the magma underground boils water that gets into the white rocks,"
22,167,00:14:00,"the limestone, that's all over the place."
22,168,00:14:04,"all the stuff that's inside the hot water seeps into the rocks,"
22,169,00:14:09,transforming it into all different kinds of rocks.
22,170,00:14:11,"that's a skarn deposit, nature's treasure chest."
22,171,00:14:15,i see.
22,172,00:14:17,that's why the parts around the cracks transform and form stripes.
22,173,00:14:21,"in other words, with magma's strength on our side,"
22,174,00:14:24,we're able to acquire super-rare gems.
22,175,00:14:31,"all right, we're here."
22,176,00:14:33,the gems we're after are inside this wall.
22,177,00:14:36,the rocks are hard as hell.
22,178,00:14:38,we twigs are useless for digging them out.
22,179,00:14:42,"we're counting on you, number-one power."
22,180,00:14:46,i didn't want to attack you head-on and get countered by science weapons.
22,181,00:14:52,but you wouldn't be alarmed if i were to raise
22,182,00:14:54,"a weapon while i'm digging for treasures, would you?"
22,183,00:14:58,you wouldn't—
22,184,00:15:00,that's right!
22,185,00:15:01,the backs of your heads are wide open right now!
22,186,00:15:10,and i was going to murder you.
22,187,00:15:14,i'm sure you were.
22,188,00:15:16,that's why you couldn't help but save us back at the mica hole.
22,189,00:15:21,i know you weren't trying to shove me into the hole.
22,190,00:15:25,you were trying to save me.
22,191,00:15:38,magma.
22,192,00:15:42,sorry.
22,193,00:15:43,i insulted you.
22,194,00:15:47,hit me.
22,195,00:15:52,i don't care anymore.
22,196,00:15:54,it doesn't change the fact that i was going to kill you!
22,197,00:16:02,the most heat-resistant rock in the universe!
22,198,00:16:04,it's ours!
22,199,00:16:06,{\an4}tungsten acquired!!
22,200,00:16:10,yeah.
22,201,00:16:12,tungsten's an insane treasure...
22,202,00:16:16,"but in this dungeon of treasures, the three of us found"
22,203,00:16:19,an even more precious treasure: the treasure of friendship.
22,204,00:16:27,what are you even talking about?
22,205,00:16:28,that's so cringy.
22,206,00:16:30,"yeah, totally cringy."
22,207,00:16:31,sh-shut up!
22,208,00:16:33,i regretted it the moment it came out of my mouth!
22,209,00:16:36,why are you two suddenly hitting it off?!
22,210,00:16:41,"oh, man, there's way too much treasure here!"
22,211,00:16:44,look! manganese!
22,212,00:16:45,manganese that's used for manganese batteries!
22,213,00:16:48,copper pyrite!
22,214,00:16:49,sphalerite!
22,215,00:16:51,they're just rocks!
22,216,00:16:52,are you done yet?!
22,217,00:16:54,the sun's going to set!
22,218,00:16:59,bring senku-chan back by evening three days from now.
22,219,00:17:03,if you do...
22,220,00:17:06,we're heading back!
22,221,00:17:08,"oh, come on, just a little longer."
22,222,00:17:11,"yeah, we found a mountain of treasure."
22,223,00:17:14,you little twigs aren't going to carry all that anyway!
22,224,00:17:18,hurry up!
22,225,00:17:20,why are you suddenly in such a hurry?
22,226,00:17:35,what the hell are you doing?!
22,227,00:17:36,{\an8}where are you taking senku?! hey!
22,228,00:17:42,"hey, senku-chan."
22,229,00:17:44,welcome back.
22,230,00:17:46,huh? what's going on?
22,231,00:17:49,"don't bother trying to call for help, senku."
22,232,00:17:52,we're all working with gen.
22,233,00:17:57,"so you bastards finally figured out the hack, huh?"
22,234,00:18:01,"all you need to do is hand science and my head over to tsukasa,"
22,235,00:18:04,and the village is safe. it's perfectly logical.
22,236,00:18:15,"i have no idea what you're talking about, but..."
22,237,00:18:42,an astronomy telescope...
22,238,00:18:46,"or rather, an observatory..."
22,239,00:18:51,i'm going to space.
22,240,00:19:15,january fourth...
22,241,00:19:16,rock day!
22,242,00:19:17,"i heard it's your birthday today, senku."
22,243,00:19:21,we all got you a birthday gift.
22,244,00:19:31,he's finally gone.
22,245,00:19:35,"hey, guys, hear me out."
22,246,00:19:39,i have an awesome idea.
22,247,00:19:43,"i mean, i just vaguely remembered thatyou can put two lenses in a tube."
22,248,00:19:49,"it's half-assed, but whatever."
22,249,00:19:51,hey
22,250,00:19:53,these people would like to help.
22,251,00:20:01,senku better get me something even more awesome for my birthday.
22,252,00:20:07,"this is way too much work, man."
22,253,00:20:10,yeah.
22,254,00:20:12,the whole village worked hard to make this.
22,255,00:20:15,"you're going to have to fine-tune it yourself, senku-chan."
22,256,00:20:19,yeah.
22,257,00:20:22,"hang on, senku! are you moved for the first time in forever?"
22,258,00:20:27,"you can cry, you know."
22,259,00:20:29,you don't need to hold it in.
22,260,00:20:31,"you're so low, ginro."
22,261,00:20:31,{\an8}go on! go on! go on!
22,262,00:20:35,"good job, everyone!"
22,263,00:20:37,this is extremely practical.
22,264,00:20:39,we can use it on our watchtower against tsukasa.
22,265,00:20:42,"y-yeah, that's true."
22,266,00:20:45,your feedback's as rational as ever.
22,267,00:20:50,a guy doesn't bother bringing up his own birthday.
22,268,00:20:56,how did you know it was today?
22,269,00:20:59,"our internal clocks are messed up from the petrification, though."
22,270,00:21:03,i don't even know how old i am anymore.
22,271,00:21:06,think about how many days you've been alive.
22,272,00:21:09,what about you?
22,273,00:21:11,"6,268 days."
22,274,00:21:14,oh... so you used a leading question on me.
22,275,00:21:17,"still, you couldn't have figured it out if you didn't know when i revived."
22,276,00:21:22,don't you remember?
22,277,00:21:23,you wrote the day your petrification was undone...
22,278,00:21:29,{\an8}ad 5738april 1
22,279,00:21:29,"by the miracle cave,"
22,280,00:21:32,as soon as you woke up.
22,281,00:21:37,so he wrote this when he was un-petrified?
22,282,00:21:41,how did he know what day it was?
22,283,00:21:43,was he... the whole time?
22,284,00:21:47,this dude's totally insane.
22,285,00:21:52,"come to think of it, ever since the beginning..."
22,286,00:21:55,since before i met you...
22,287,00:21:57,"i've been rather fond of you, senku-chan, setting aside personal gains."
22,288,00:22:04,i'm sure it's the same for the other villagers.
22,289,00:22:08,"you might say that's cringy, though."
22,290,00:22:16,"yeah, that's cringy."
22,291,00:22:18,see?

23,1,00:00:11,you can see so far away!
23,2,00:00:15,the sun's gonna rise soon!
23,3,00:00:18,don't look at the sun through the telescope.
23,4,00:00:21,if the stones you guys got are the right ones...
23,5,00:00:30,"wow, it's like a mountain of jewels."
23,6,00:00:33,it's not like a mountain of jewels. it is a mountain of jewels.
23,7,00:00:37,it's a treasure trove of super rare metals.
23,8,00:00:42,"jewels, my ass."
23,9,00:00:44,they're just slightly heavy rocks.
23,10,00:00:46,after all that fuss...
23,11,00:00:48,we're going to win against tsukasa-chan's army with these rocks.
23,12,00:00:52,with these rocks?
23,13,00:00:54,i see.
23,14,00:00:55,with these gems!
23,15,00:00:57,i can see them being heavy enough to really hurt.
23,16,00:00:59,"father, i don't think that's what..."
23,17,00:01:01,you can't blame him.
23,18,00:01:03,father is of an older generation.
23,19,00:01:05,what?!
23,20,00:01:07,we're up against tsukasa-chan's army. they're going to be seriously tough.
23,21,00:01:11,our plan is to make cell phones using these rocks and win the information war.
23,22,00:01:18,"but, senku, how much longer is it going to take to make our cell phones?"
23,23,00:01:22,she's right.
23,24,00:01:23,"once spring comes, tsukasa-kun's army is going to be rushing in."
23,25,00:01:27,the goal's not that far away.
23,26,00:01:29,to put it simply...
23,27,00:01:30,the vacuum tube is the heart of the cell phone.

23,82,00:03:45,"but, senku, how are we going to get it out of the stone?"
23,83,00:03:49,about that... it's going to be tough as hell.
23,84,00:03:53,what the hell are you two doing?!
23,85,00:03:56,"we're getting it out of the rocks, aren't we?"
23,86,00:03:58,all we need to do is destroy it.
23,87,00:04:01,"i mean, that works."
23,88,00:04:03,"we'll be turning it into powder, anyway."
23,89,00:04:05,see? i was right!
23,90,00:04:07,no one asked you!
23,91,00:04:09,what if you'd been wrong?!
23,92,00:04:13,this is unusual.
23,93,00:04:15,"he's hardly doing it right, but i've never seen him offer to help."
23,94,00:04:20,did something happen in the cave?
23,95,00:04:23,you get to see all the insane stuff that humanity worked together
23,96,00:04:26,for two million years to build.stuff you never would've seen otherwise.
23,97,00:04:30,"and i'll show you so much of it, it'll make your head spin."
23,98,00:04:34,senku!
23,99,00:04:35,i don't care if you're the boss anymore.
23,100,00:04:38,"at least, until we deal with that tsukasa guy."
23,101,00:04:42,"gee, i don't know."
23,102,00:04:45,we're done.
23,103,00:04:47,what's next?
23,104,00:04:48,i'm going to do chemistry stuff to this powdered blue rock
23,105,00:04:51,to turn it into something resembling toothpaste.
23,106,00:04:54,"right, you're doing chemistry stuff."
23,107,00:04:57,the stuff it wouldn't do me any good to ask about.
23,108,00:05:00,"lastly, we're going to get rid of the rust on the toothpaste stuff using hydrogen,"
23,109,00:05:04,"warm it up in a glass container, and it's done."
23,110,00:05:08,"it needs to be at least 1,000 degrees."
23,111,00:05:10,"the hotter it is, the stronger the tungsten will be."
23,112,00:05:14,so all we have to do is cook it.
23,113,00:05:17,"hey, it's actually pretty easy."
23,114,00:05:19,"what are you, stupid?"
23,115,00:05:21,what would happen to a glass container
23,116,00:05:23,"if you threw it into a fire that's 1,000 degrees?"
23,117,00:05:26,{\an8}tungsten
23,118,00:05:26,{\an8}glass
23,119,00:05:29,we have to heat up just the tungsten toothpaste inside the glass container.
23,120,00:05:34,then we need a heating mechanism with pinpoint accuracy.
23,121,00:05:37,how do we do it?
23,122,00:05:38,we don't have time. let's split up the work.
23,123,00:05:41,i'll deal with the toothpaste-making chemistry stuff.
23,124,00:05:44,so who's making the pinpoint heating mechanism?
23,125,00:05:48,are there any other science users?
23,126,00:05:56,"chrome, you know everything you need to make one from scratch."
23,127,00:06:00,throw all the science tricks you've learned at it.
23,128,00:06:04,or do you need senku-sensei's help?
23,129,00:06:09,don't make me laugh.
23,130,00:06:12,i'm chrome!
23,131,00:06:13,i'm a smart-as-hell science user!
23,132,00:06:18,don't come crying to me for help at your lab.
23,133,00:06:22,"yeah, i got the lab stuff."
23,134,00:06:25,i'm leaving you in charge of the heating team.
23,135,00:06:31,you make me jealous.
23,136,00:06:36,"you know, i've always loved making things, even as a kid."
23,137,00:06:44,"i made all sorts of things—bridges, shields—"
23,138,00:06:47,so that people wouldn't look at me funny.
23,139,00:06:50,"thanks to that, i get to pretend i'm still in the game, even at this age."
23,140,00:06:57,"but to be honest, i can't help but wish i had a maker buddy, too."
23,141,00:07:06,"but you have two friends, old man kaseki."
23,142,00:07:09,maker buddies.
23,143,00:07:12,two?
23,144,00:07:13,where?
23,145,00:07:17,right here.
23,146,00:07:23,me?
23,147,00:07:24,even though i'm almost fifty years older than you?
23,148,00:07:28,our age?
23,149,00:07:28,that matters somehow?
23,150,00:07:59,what the hell?!
23,151,00:08:03,he's even more gung-ho than usual.
23,152,00:08:07,"come help me over here, modern man."
23,153,00:08:10,you must know at least a little more chemistry than the villagers.
23,154,00:08:13,i'm not sure.
23,155,00:08:15,there's a ridiculous number of steps.
23,156,00:08:17,"i bet you won't get a millimeter of this, so i'll make it simple."
23,157,00:08:21,cook the blue gem powder in sodium hydroxide;
23,158,00:08:24,"use sea shells, hydrochloric acid,and ammonia to crystallize it;"
23,159,00:08:26,and then bake it and mix it with honey.
23,160,00:08:30,"okay! i understood all of that, senku-chan."
23,161,00:08:34,"honey! bake it, and then honey."
23,162,00:08:37,i got that much.
23,163,00:08:39,chrome's definitely ten billion times more useful than you.
23,164,00:08:42,"nah, i don't think anyonecould have kept up with that."
23,165,00:08:46,"you're the only one who gets it, senku-chan."
23,166,00:08:50,nothing beats this when it comes to pinpoint heating!
23,167,00:08:53,there it is! chrome's special move!
23,168,00:08:56,quit showing it off.
23,169,00:08:57,you're reminding me of bad times.
23,170,00:09:01,"i don't know how much heat it produces, though."
23,171,00:09:05,let's set up some metals in order of heat resistance
23,172,00:09:07,so we can measure the temperature.
23,173,00:09:22,"it's not even doing anything to the lead,and that's the weakest one."
23,174,00:09:26,"it's winter, after all."
23,175,00:09:28,if we just had a little more sunlight...
23,176,00:09:33,throw all the science tricks you've learned at it.
23,177,00:09:37,"we're using fire, too."
23,178,00:09:39,add the cotton candy machine to the pinpoint heating!
23,179,00:09:43,{\an8}blorp...
23,180,00:09:43,{\an8}lead
23,181,00:09:45,damn! we need more than just me and suika.
23,182,00:09:48,"we defeated the lead, though."
23,183,00:09:50,{\an8}blurrp
23,184,00:09:50,{\an8}gold
23,185,00:09:50,{\an8}silver
23,186,00:09:51,"wow, we beat gold and silver!"
23,187,00:09:55,"good going, battle team!"
23,188,00:09:57,{\an8}blurrgh
23,189,00:09:57,{\an8}iron
23,190,00:09:57,we made it to iron!
23,191,00:09:59,"go, gorilla team!"
23,192,00:10:03,"we made it past 1,000 degrees!"
23,193,00:10:06,"it needs to be at least 1,000 degrees."
23,194,00:10:08,"the hotter it is, the stronger the tungsten will be."
23,195,00:10:12,"no, we need more."
23,196,00:10:13,add electricity power!
23,197,00:10:22,"all right, it's done!"
23,198,00:10:24,tungsten toothpaste!
23,199,00:10:27,"how are things on your side, heating team?"
23,200,00:10:29,we're just about done.
23,201,00:10:31,"not bad, science user."
23,202,00:10:38,what the hell is this all-of-the-above mega set?!
23,203,00:10:41,"senku, you were the one who said to throw everything at it."
23,204,00:10:45,this isn't what i meant.
23,205,00:10:47,this thing's ugly as hell.
23,206,00:10:53,"honestly, though, this might actually be the best solution."
23,207,00:10:57,if the goal is for all of us to join together to raise the temperature...
23,208,00:11:03,"we're going to make a long, thin blob of tungsten toothpaste."
23,209,00:11:06,"zap water with electricity, and it'll produce hydrogen."
23,210,00:11:09,"that hydrogen, with a lot of heat, peels the rust right off the toothpaste."
23,211,00:11:13,here we go. pinpoint heating...
23,212,00:11:16,...to several thousand degrees!
23,213,00:11:32,we have the most heat-resistant metal in the universe...
23,214,00:11:36,a tungsten filament!
23,215,00:11:46,"now, we have everything we need."
23,216,00:11:50,{\an8}ramen
23,217,00:11:51,we're on our final sprint to making cell phones!
23,218,00:11:53,let's get it done one step at a time.
23,219,00:11:56,"time to build the cell phone's heart, the vacuum tube."
23,220,00:12:00,there's some slightly complicated glasswork we need done to finish that.
23,221,00:12:05,"i don't know if even you can handle it, old man kaseki."
23,222,00:12:10,"oh, please."
23,223,00:12:11,"i made this ridiculously challenging, twisty thing before."
23,224,00:12:16,it'll take more than that to scare me.
23,225,00:12:18,"here, show me the blueprint."
23,226,00:12:24,"{\an8}""hickman pump"""
23,227,00:12:24,it's called a hickman pump.
23,228,00:12:27,its vacuum action is off the charts!
23,229,00:12:29,a level ten billion vacuum pump!
23,230,00:12:31,you sound like a vacuum cleaner commercial.
23,231,00:12:34,vacuum tubes are made by removing as much air as possible.
23,232,00:12:38,the prototype we built before was a simple level-one pump for light bulbs.
23,233,00:12:44,it won't give us enough power.
23,234,00:12:44,air
23,235,00:12:45,air
23,236,00:12:46,where do i even begin?
23,237,00:12:49,is this even humanly possible?
23,238,00:12:53,"in our age, only the super talented craftsmen built hickman pumps."
23,239,00:13:00,"then again, it was a different age, so don't feel too bad, kaseki-chan."
23,240,00:13:05,it'll never work.
23,241,00:13:07,is that true?
23,242,00:13:08,yeah.
23,243,00:13:09,"it's true, but why would a mentalist know that?"
23,244,00:13:12,he's just talking out of his ass to get kaseki fired up.
23,245,00:13:21,i'm fine.
23,246,00:13:23,i don't need your mental care.
23,247,00:13:25,"it's the complicated stuff that gets me fired up, anyway."
23,248,00:13:29,"in exchange, though..."
23,249,00:13:32,i want to do that thing you did with chrome the other day.
23,250,00:13:39,y'know...
23,251,00:13:40,as maker buddies.
23,252,00:13:47,all right!
23,253,00:13:48,"you can handle the vacuum tube, kaseki."
23,254,00:13:53,gotcha!
23,255,00:13:59,"hey, hey, senku..."
23,256,00:14:01,i just noticed something.
23,257,00:14:03,"old man kaseki's acting like a kid and all,"
23,258,00:14:07,but he's actually trying to lighten your burden a little.
23,259,00:14:11,"{\an8}i know that. what are you, stupid?"
23,260,00:14:16,s-senku...
23,261,00:14:19,is there anything we kids can do?
23,262,00:14:24,yeah.
23,263,00:14:25,"suika, you guys can handle the wire."
23,264,00:14:29,yay!
23,265,00:14:31,"we're members of the kingdom of science, too."
23,266,00:14:35,we kids are going to make the wire without relying on senku!
23,267,00:14:40,yeah!
23,268,00:14:43,now the chemistry team can focus on making plastic.
23,269,00:14:49,yeah!
23,270,00:14:50,although i have no idea what this whatever-tic stuff is.
23,271,00:14:53,"actually, that's the step on the road map that i was the most worried about."
23,272,00:14:57,{\an8}copper

23,276,00:14:57,{\an8}plastic
23,277,00:14:57,can we even make plastic in this world?
23,278,00:15:01,"isn't it made from, like, petroleum or something?"
23,279,00:15:05,"come, gen, you're with us."
23,280,00:15:07,i'm going to work you to death in return for getting me hyped up.
23,281,00:15:12,so mean!
23,282,00:15:15,"old man kaseki's kind of got a soft spot for gen, huh?"
23,283,00:15:23,let's hurry up and start making some plastic.
23,284,00:15:25,"first, we simmer some wood and boil the liquid that comes out."
23,285,00:15:29,"pour it over some hot copper, and—"
23,286,00:15:31,"wait, wait, wait!"
23,287,00:15:33,i'm completely lost.
23,288,00:15:35,"you heat it to get some liquid, heat that again, and heat that again?"
23,289,00:15:39,what are we even doing?
23,290,00:15:41,"we're modding the heck out of it, adding and removing ingredients."
23,291,00:15:45,chemistry is all about addition and subtraction.
23,292,00:15:49,"we did some addition and subtraction, and now we have formalin."
23,293,00:15:52,it's the stuff you use to preserve corpses.
23,294,00:15:54,the smell!
23,295,00:15:55,here we go again with the sketchy chemicals having to do with corpses and stuff!
23,296,00:15:59,good.
23,297,00:16:00,now we just need a ton of coal ash.
23,298,00:16:03,coal ash plus sodium hydroxide plus formaline makes
23,299,00:16:07,"humanity's first synthetic plastic, bakelite."
23,300,00:16:11,r-right.
23,301,00:16:13,"so we just need to burn a crazy amount of coal, right?"
23,302,00:16:19,my hands are numb from cold.
23,303,00:16:21,we aren't getting much work done.
23,304,00:16:23,what a harsh winter this is.
23,305,00:16:26,i hope no one dies from the cold this year.
23,306,00:16:34,coal?
23,307,00:16:35,yeah.
23,308,00:16:35,we need a stupid amount of it.
23,309,00:16:38,this is just the job for you guys.
23,310,00:16:40,"hey, ginro."
23,311,00:16:42,where to?
23,312,00:16:43,"oh, you know, i have to train, too."
23,313,00:16:47,"and i already work as a guard protecting the village,"
23,314,00:16:49,so i think i'll pass.
23,315,00:16:51,what are you talking about?
23,316,00:16:53,the village elder senku's word is law.
23,317,00:17:00,this is totally going to be one of those hard jobs!
23,318,00:17:02,rules are rules.
23,319,00:17:18,it's so warm in this house.
23,320,00:17:21,let's make a warm meal for everyone to eat.
23,321,00:17:25,we can get our work done a lot faster now.
23,322,00:17:31,we're only after the ashes from the coals.
23,323,00:17:35,"if you want to sit by the fire, suit yourselves."
23,324,00:17:42,this is impressive.
23,325,00:17:46,"what you're making is totally unrelated,"
23,326,00:17:51,and yet the village becomes more and more enriched.
23,327,00:17:56,yeah.
23,328,00:17:57,that's the way science is.
23,329,00:18:15,"senku, my decision to grant you the throne wasn't in error."
23,330,00:18:24,huh? zinc-carbon batteries?
23,331,00:18:26,are we using batteries to finish the vacuum tubes?
23,332,00:18:30,the build instructions and materials are there.
23,333,00:18:33,we'll use the manganese we got in the caves.
23,334,00:18:36,"so you want me to make them, right?"
23,335,00:18:48,zinc for seaweed.
23,336,00:18:49,manganese rice balls.
23,337,00:18:51,coal in the middle.
23,338,00:18:53,"look at that, a zinc-carbon battery."
23,339,00:18:55,"look at that, a zinc-carbon battery."
23,340,00:18:57,huh?
23,341,00:18:58,it's already done.
23,342,00:19:00,it wasn't that brutal!
23,343,00:19:04,manganese rice balls.
23,344,00:19:06,tons of manganese.
23,345,00:19:07,manganese rice balls.
23,346,00:19:09,lots of manganese.
23,347,00:19:11,manganese rice balls.
23,348,00:19:13,tons of manganese.
23,349,00:19:15,we need 800 of those.
23,350,00:19:16,what?! eight hundred?!
23,351,00:19:20,this is brutal.
23,352,00:19:22,"i'll help, of course."
23,353,00:19:26,here's the wine you asked for.
23,354,00:19:28,are you holding a banquet or something?
23,355,00:19:30,"no, we're making microphones, the cell phone's vocal cord."
23,356,00:19:34,with wine?
23,357,00:19:35,yeah.
23,358,00:19:37,"actually, we're using the pink grains stuck on the lid here."
23,359,00:19:42,then we mix some cooked seaweed in hot water.
23,360,00:19:46,that's it.
23,361,00:19:48,"which part of this is the ""microphone"" thing?"
23,362,00:19:51,"also, what are these shiny rocks?"
23,363,00:19:54,they're called rochelle salts.
23,364,00:19:56,they turn sound into electricity.
23,365,00:19:58,"tack this onto something light,"
23,366,00:20:00,"like a plastic megaphone, and you get a microphone."
23,367,00:21:09,we've cleared plastic!
23,368,00:21:11,we've cleared wire!
23,369,00:21:18,we've cleared vacuum tubes!

23,401,00:21:52,"oh, man!"
23,402,00:21:55,we managed to finish it before spring.
23,403,00:22:07,the final battle against tsukasa is at hand.
23,404,00:22:17,this is exhilarating.

24,36,00:02:33,the cell phone is born!
24,37,00:02:39,yeah!
24,38,00:02:44,our voices are going to travel across the skies and far into the distance.
24,39,00:02:49,it's so strange.
24,40,00:02:51,yeah.
24,41,00:02:52,so it's great that we're sending our voices over long distances...
24,42,00:02:55,but how are we going to hear them?
24,43,00:03:01,whoops! we're going to need another one.
24,44,00:03:06,"you kept quiet about that on purpose, didn't you?"
24,45,00:03:09,because people might give up if you told them we need to make two.
24,46,00:03:13,{\an4}we neededmore than onecell phone!!
24,47,00:03:14,tee-hee.
24,48,00:03:22,we do need another one to make it work as a cell phone.
24,49,00:03:26,"but if we run a long cable, it should work as a phone."
24,50,00:03:43,"ruri can hear me if i talk through here, right?"
24,51,00:03:53,ahem.
24,52,00:03:55,"chrome, have you chosen your historic first words for the phones"
24,53,00:04:00,we've finally built?
24,54,00:04:03,ruri-chan's listening on the other end.
24,55,00:04:05,"come on, it's your chance to tell her how you really feel."
24,56,00:04:09,this is your moment.
24,57,00:04:17,my true feelings...
24,58,00:04:24,hit the switch!
24,59,00:04:26,it's on!
24,60,00:04:32,ruri...
24,61,00:04:39,"did you see that, ruri? pretty awesome, right?!"
24,62,00:04:42,science is insane!
24,63,00:04:48,"what's up with you all, anyway?"
24,64,00:04:51,i heard them!
24,65,00:04:52,it worked!
24,66,00:04:53,how does this thing work?
24,67,00:04:54,i'm shocked.
24,68,00:04:56,that was definitely chrome's voice.
24,69,00:04:58,i don't get it.
24,70,00:05:00,how can something so tiny speak?
24,71,00:05:03,it's almost like a speaker.
24,72,00:05:05,"""almost like""? it's literally a speaker."
24,73,00:05:08,microphones and speakers just convert between sound and electricity.
24,74,00:05:12,they're the same...
24,75,00:05:14,ruri.
24,76,00:05:16,what did you just say?
24,77,00:05:18,"""it's almost like a speaker""?"
24,78,00:05:20,"huh, a speaker?"
24,79,00:05:22,so is this a bee?
24,80,00:05:24,it's a bee! a bee!
24,81,00:05:25,huh? speakers are bees?
24,82,00:05:29,"um, i mean... aren't speakers a kind of bee?"
24,83,00:05:33,how did that happen?
24,84,00:05:36,it was in the hundred tales.
24,85,00:05:39,that's how it was passed down?
24,86,00:05:40,yes.
24,87,00:05:42,in tale 14 of the hundred tales...
24,88,00:05:46,there's a talkative bee named speaker.
24,89,00:05:50,"when it poked gravestones with its needle,"
24,90,00:05:53,it could speak in the voices of the dead.
24,91,00:06:01,speaker...
24,92,00:06:03,needles on gravestones...
24,93,00:06:04,voices of the dead...
24,94,00:06:06,that story isn't transferring any kind of knowledge.
24,95,00:06:10,i don't get what it's for.
24,96,00:06:12,that's super suspicious.
24,97,00:06:15,"it's using the word ""speaker"" to try to"
24,98,00:06:17,communicate something only to modern humans.
24,99,00:06:21,and it's tale number 14.
24,100,00:06:25,"one and four, or ""i"" and ""shi,"" as in ""ishi (stone)."""
24,101,00:06:29,it's your birthday.
24,102,00:06:32,it's said that these are the graves of byakuya-sama and the other founders.
24,103,00:06:39,my old man's gravestone...
24,104,00:06:41,the cemetery!
24,105,00:06:53,"what do you think you're doing, senku? that's sacrilege!"
24,106,00:06:56,what? is there something about that gravestone?
24,107,00:07:01,i should have noticed a lot sooner.
24,108,00:07:04,that man is such a pain in the ass.
24,109,00:07:06,just the gravestones of the founders?
24,110,00:07:09,"now that i think about it,that's ten billion percent bull."
24,111,00:07:14,this isn't a gravestone.
24,112,00:07:16,it's a time capsule that's been kept solid in concrete.
24,113,00:07:22,a time capsule?
24,114,00:07:24,is there something inside it?
24,115,00:07:27,"yeah, we need to break it to get inside."
24,116,00:07:29,"we're breaking it, then?!"
24,117,00:07:32,"hold it, meat head!"
24,118,00:07:34,"if i'm right, there's glass in this."
24,119,00:07:37,we're going to need someone with both power and speed to crack it swiftly.
24,120,00:07:46,so fast!
24,121,00:07:51,there's something inside!
24,122,00:07:53,it's some kind of silver chunk.
24,123,00:08:00,it's silver because it's wrapped in aluminum foil.
24,124,00:08:04,if we wash it with hydrochloric acid...
24,125,00:08:10,it's actually glass!
24,126,00:08:12,a saucer?
24,127,00:08:13,it looks like they cut out the bottom of a bottle or something.
24,128,00:08:16,a saucer.
24,129,00:08:18,speaker.
24,130,00:08:19,speaking with needles.
24,131,00:08:23,does that remind you of anything?
24,132,00:08:28,it's a record!
24,133,00:08:30,my dad and the crew's voices are on there.
24,134,00:08:35,they bothered to leave us a voice recording.
24,135,00:08:38,let's hear what they had to say.
24,136,00:08:42,"i'll kill you if it isn't something exhilarating,"
24,137,00:08:46,you deadbeat dad.
24,138,00:08:49,chrome was right.
24,139,00:08:52,science truly is beautiful.
24,140,00:08:54,it lets senku-san's father speak to him from heaven.
24,141,00:09:02,"now, thousands of years later, traveling through time with science."
24,142,00:09:17,"hey, senku..."
24,143,00:09:18,"does that mean that ""record"" thing can trap sound?"
24,144,00:09:22,b-b-but you can't even catch sound.
24,145,00:09:26,i'm so confused.
24,146,00:09:28,how?
24,147,00:09:29,the way a record works is ridiculously simple.
24,148,00:09:33,hella lit!
24,149,00:09:36,"you make a needle vibrate with sound, which digs grooves into the record."
24,150,00:09:40,"and then, if you run a needle over the grooves to vibrate it,"
24,151,00:09:44,it'll make the same sounds that dug them.
24,152,00:09:47,hella lit!
24,153,00:09:49,digging grooves in glass makes it store sound?
24,154,00:09:54,that's a surprise.
24,155,00:09:55,senku's dad is awesome!
24,156,00:09:57,"nah, that's not true."
24,157,00:10:00,byakuya couldn't have done it.
24,158,00:10:02,it must have been the people with him that made it.
24,159,00:10:05,astronauts are all science elites.
24,160,00:10:09,"all of them except byakuya, who got in by luck."
24,161,00:10:13,although he might have been the one who came up with the idea.
24,162,00:10:17,he's the only one who'd think of something so lame.
24,163,00:10:34,i bet we could make a record if we used the bottom of a bottle.
24,164,00:10:38,th-that sounds like a good idea.
24,165,00:10:41,glass is a lot more durable than plastic.
24,166,00:10:43,"preserved correctly, it could last tens of thousands of years."
24,167,00:10:46,huh...
24,168,00:10:48,did you know that?
24,169,00:10:49,not at all.
24,170,00:10:51,i just thought it could work because it's round.
24,171,00:10:53,"you could have just said ""yes,"" pops."
24,172,00:10:57,"well, anyway, that's that. so give me a hand, guys."
24,173,00:11:04,"hey, they left."
24,174,00:11:06,come on! be nicer to the old man!
24,175,00:11:10,shamil!
24,176,00:11:13,"we don't have enough parts, old man."
24,177,00:11:16,there might be something we can use on the soyuz.
24,178,00:11:28,hey!
24,179,00:11:30,i found something!
24,180,00:11:34,"my buddy, the electric shaver!"
24,181,00:11:39,"sorry, mister shaver.your motor won't go to waste."
24,182,00:11:46,we can make a record player pretty easily using the things we've made so far.
24,183,00:11:52,we'll use the gear from the cotton candy machine.
24,184,00:11:54,i went and got it.
24,185,00:11:57,destroying father's shield was well worth it.
24,186,00:12:00,it's doing so much good.
24,187,00:12:02,your father's happy as long as it's useful to you.
24,188,00:12:09,this is how people become cogs in society as they get older.
24,189,00:12:14,literally.
24,190,00:12:15,no one asked for your words of wisdom.
24,191,00:12:20,i'm back.
24,192,00:12:21,i use this when i'm knitting.
24,193,00:12:25,this is perfect.
24,194,00:12:28,a bone needle.
24,195,00:12:30,the playback side of making a record is dead easy.
24,196,00:12:33,recording is another matter.
24,197,00:12:36,"you're cutting glass, so you need a hard rock."
24,198,00:12:40,"like corundum or diamond, right?"
24,199,00:12:44,"please, use this."
24,200,00:12:48,i don't know...
24,201,00:12:51,it's diamond.
24,202,00:12:53,isn't that your wedding ring?
24,203,00:12:55,you can't. that's too important.
24,204,00:12:59,"i don't wear it all the time, anyway."
24,205,00:13:01,it gets in the way.
24,206,00:13:02,i'm sure the diamond will be happier serving as a record needle.
24,207,00:13:06,"but in exchange,"
24,208,00:13:08,you have to let us in on building the recorder and making recordings.
24,209,00:13:14,"thanks, guys."
24,210,00:13:27,yeah!
24,211,00:13:28,that took no time at all!
24,212,00:13:32,{\an4}record playeracquired!!
24,213,00:13:37,what's going on?
24,214,00:13:38,"apparently, we're going to hear the voices of the founders."
24,215,00:13:41,the founders?
24,216,00:13:43,the voices of people from thousands of years ago?
24,217,00:13:46,all right.
24,218,00:13:48,"let's spin it, ginro."
24,219,00:13:49,okay.
24,220,00:13:50,"i've gotten good at spinning this, from the cotton candy machine."
24,221,00:14:06,"i don't know who's listening to this,"
24,222,00:14:09,"hundreds, maybe thousands of years from now..."
24,223,00:14:14,but i'm the astronaut ishigami byakuya.
24,224,00:14:20,shut up. i can't hear.
24,225,00:14:23,this is the voice of the founder of ishigami village...
24,226,00:14:26,senku's father's actual voice!
24,227,00:14:31,just kidding!
24,228,00:14:33,that's it for the stuffy formalities.
24,229,00:14:38,"you revived from the petrification, and now you're listening to this recording."
24,230,00:14:44,"senku, it's you, isn't it?"
24,231,00:14:47,i can tell.
24,232,00:14:49,"hundreds, thousands, maybe an unthinkable number of years later,"
24,233,00:14:55,i'm making my final call to you.
24,234,00:14:59,not that i can hear you...
24,235,00:15:03,"senku, don't forget."
24,236,00:15:06,"i've always, always..."
24,237,00:15:12,"nah, you don't need that dramatic father-and-son crap, do you?"
24,238,00:15:17,let's get right to business.
24,239,00:15:20,you really do get it.
24,240,00:15:21,he's so cold to his father.
24,241,00:15:24,"you're really not any better, kohaku."
24,242,00:15:30,"senku, if you're still having a hard time"
24,243,00:15:33,"winning over the hearts of the villagers,"
24,244,00:15:38,let them hear this.
24,245,00:15:46,to those for whom the light of music has dimmed!
24,246,00:16:22,"why a record, all of a sudden?"
24,247,00:16:24,i've been thinking the whole time...
24,248,00:16:27,how do we keep all the knowledge and fun stuff that
24,249,00:16:30,humanity's come up with from disappearing?
24,250,00:16:34,besides...
24,251,00:16:36,i wanted to leave something that would be exhilarating for senku to hear.
24,252,00:17:57,song...
24,253,00:17:58,but it's too pretty.
24,254,00:18:01,it's the voice of an angel.
24,255,00:18:04,it's so amazing!
24,256,00:18:06,the song is so...
24,257,00:18:08,it's so amazing!
24,258,00:18:09,it's amazing!
24,259,00:18:09,your vocabulary...
24,260,00:18:11,lilian-chan was one of the top singers of our age.
24,261,00:18:16,imagine that being the first song you hear.
24,262,00:18:19,"oh, man."
24,263,00:18:20,two million years of humanity...
24,264,00:18:23,"oh, man!"
24,265,00:18:24,"senku, was there all kinds of awesome music like this in the past?"
24,266,00:18:30,yeah.
24,267,00:18:31,and not just music.
24,268,00:18:33,"games, tv, comics, movies..."
24,269,00:18:38,all entertainment that science made possible.
24,270,00:18:44,there was a ton of incredibly fun stuff all over the world.
24,271,00:18:49,"the real thing's gone now, but it's all there..."
24,272,00:18:57,in people's hearts.
24,273,00:19:03,"i'm going to let all of you see it,"
24,274,00:19:06,once we take down the tsukasa empire and revive all the world's statues.
24,275,00:19:15,i really want to see everything!
24,276,00:19:17,this is so damn exciting!
24,277,00:19:20,all the world's statues!
24,278,00:19:22,let's revive them all!
24,279,00:19:24,"so our first step is to take down the so-called tsukasa empire, is that right?"
24,280,00:19:29,this is awesome.
24,281,00:19:31,everyone's totally pumped!
24,282,00:19:33,your dad's got skill.
24,283,00:19:37,he's motivated the entire village
24,284,00:19:37,{\an8}we must defeat the enemy quickly and revive all those statues.
24,285,00:19:39,to revive all the people who've been petrified.
24,286,00:19:41,{\an8}yes.
24,287,00:19:43,all with just lilian-chan's singing.
24,288,00:19:46,doesn't this also wash away your guilt for having dragged
24,289,00:19:51,the villagers into a war?
24,290,00:19:57,i've never had that kind of guilt.
24,291,00:20:06,senku.
24,292,00:20:10,you actually made what you said that day come true.
24,293,00:20:17,just like you said on the day we first met...
24,294,00:20:25,this whole village has become a nation of science.
24,295,00:20:33,so it's finally beginning.
24,296,00:20:35,the battle between the kingdom of science and the tsukasa empire.
24,297,00:20:39,yeah!
24,298,00:20:40,we better get that second cell phone built and bring it over.
24,299,00:20:44,"which means, senku-chan, those two are finally up to bat."
24,300,00:20:49,yeah.
24,301,00:20:50,we're finally connecting.
24,302,00:20:53,"the entire kingdom of science, the whole of its might."
24,303,00:21:01,"it's almost been a year now, huh?"
24,304,00:21:05,yeah.
24,305,00:21:07,"we're waiting for you, sen—"
24,306,00:21:09,"don't raise your voice, taiju-kun!"
24,307,00:21:11,shoot! that's right!
24,308,00:21:16,senku...
24,309,00:21:31,spring is not far off.
24,310,00:21:34,yeah.
24,311,00:21:36,the final battle with senku is near.
24,312,00:21:41,now...
24,313,00:21:42,"let's snuff the flame of science forever and build a new, untarnished world."
24,314,00:21:59,"the final battle against the tsukasa empire, on our home turf..."
24,315,00:22:04,it's the beginning of the stone wars.
24,316,00:22:16,this is exhilarating.
24,317,00:22:25,{\an8}season 2 confirmed
24,318,00:24:01,"this is a work of fiction, but the plants,animals, and production methods described are based on reality.foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerousand, in some cases, illegal. please do not imitate without expertise."
